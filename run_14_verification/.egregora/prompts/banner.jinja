Generate a striking, minimalist blog banner image for this post:

Title: {{ post_title }}
Summary: {{ post_summary }}

Design Requirements:
- Style: Abstract, conceptual, minimalist modern editorial
- Composition: Keep the UPPER 30% relatively clean for potential text overlay
- Focus: Main visual interest in the LOWER 2/3
- Colors: Bold but harmonious (2-4 colors maximum)
- NO text or typography in the image itself
- NO photorealism or complex details
- Use geometric forms, gradients, and symbolic elements

Think like an artist creating a visual metaphor, not a photographer capturing a scene.
The image should capture the essence of the article without literal depictions.
