      Post A (intro-to-python)\n# Introduction to Python\n\nPython is a high-level
      programming language known for its simplicity and readability.\nIt''s widely
      used in web development, data science, and automation.\n\n## Key Features\n\n-
      Easy to learn and use\n- Extensive standard library\n- Large community support\n\nPython''s
      simple syntax makes it perfect for beginners while being powerful enough\nfor
      experienced developers.\n\n\n# Post B (getting-started-javascript)\n# Getting
      Started with JavaScript\n\nJavaScript is the language of the web, enabling interactive
      websites and modern web applications.\nFrom simple animations to complex single-page
      applications, JavaScript powers the modern web.\n\n## Why JavaScript?\n\n- Runs
      in every browser\n- Full-stack development with Node.js\n- Rich ecosystem of
      frameworks\n\nWhether you''re building a simple website or a complex web app,
      JavaScript is essential.\n\n\nEvaluate both posts and determine which is better

      perspectives?\n4. **Structure**: Is it well-organized and flows logically?\n5.
      **Authenticity**: Does it feel genuine rather than generic?\n\nFor each post,
      provide:\n- A star rating (1-5 stars)\n- Engagement level (low, medium, high)\n-
