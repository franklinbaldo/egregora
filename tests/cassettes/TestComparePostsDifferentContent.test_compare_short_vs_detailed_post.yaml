      Post A (intro-to-python)\n# Introduction to Python\n\nPython is a high-level
      programming language known for its simplicity and readability.\nIt''s widely
      used in web development, data science, and automation.\n\n## Key Features\n\n-
      Easy to learn and use\n- Extensive standard library\n- Large community support\n\nPython''s
      simple syntax makes it perfect for beginners while being powerful enough\nfor
      experienced developers.\n\n\n# Post B (importance-of-testing)\n# The Importance
      of Testing\n\nTesting is crucial for software quality. Without proper tests,
      bugs slip through\nand technical debt accumulates rapidly.\n\n## Types of Testing\n\n-
      Unit tests\n- Integration tests\n- End-to-end tests\n\nWrite tests. Always.\n\n\nEvaluate
      both posts and determine which is better quality overall.\n"}]}],"systemInstruction":{"parts":[{"text":"You
