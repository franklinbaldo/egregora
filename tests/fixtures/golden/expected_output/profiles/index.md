# Participant Profiles

Group participants are identified by UUIDs to preserve privacy.

Profiles are automatically generated based on participation patterns and topics of interest.

## Identity System

- **Default UUID**: Everyone starts with anonymous pseudonym (e.g., `a1b2c3d4`)
- **Optional aliases**: Use `/egregora set alias "Your Name"` to humanize
- **Full opt-out**: Use `/egregora opt-out` to remove your messages

See [alias documentation](https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora/blob/main/ALIASES.md) for more details.

*Profiles are dynamically updated as conversations evolve.*
