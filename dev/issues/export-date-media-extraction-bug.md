# Critical Bug: Media Extraction Failure Due to export_date Mismatch

## Problem

**CRITICAL BUG**: Media files are never extracted for historical dates because the `export_date` is hardcoded to `date.today()`, but media extraction logic expects it to match the message dates.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Bug Chain
1. **Export Creation**: `export_date = date.today()` (e.g., 2025-10-10)
2. **Media Extraction**: Code groups exports by `export.export_date` into `exports_by_date` dict
3. **Target Date Lookup**: For each historical date (e.g., 2025-03-02), looks for `exports_by_date.get(target_date, [])`
4. **Result**: Since `export_date != target_date` for historical data, lookup returns `[]`
5. **Impact**: **NO MEDIA FILES ARE EXTRACTED** for any historical dates

### Code Analysis
```python
# processor.py line 293 - THE BUG
export_date = date.today()  # Always today's date!

# processor.py line 483-485 - Groups by export date  
exports_by_date: dict[date, list] = {}
for export in source.exports:
    exports_by_date.setdefault(export.export_date, []).append(export)

# processor.py line 500 - Lookup fails for historical dates
for export in exports_by_date.get(target_date, []):  # Returns [] for historical dates!
```

## Impact Assessment

### Severity: **CRITICAL**
- **Complete Media Loss**: All attachments (images, videos, audio) from historical exports are lost
- **Silent Failure**: No error messages, just missing media files
- **Data Integrity**: Users lose important context from shared media

### Affected Scenarios
- ✅ **Today's Messages**: Media extracted correctly (if export_date == target_date)
- ❌ **Yesterday's Messages**: Media lost
- ❌ **Historical Exports**: All media lost
- ❌ **Multi-day Exports**: Only today's media extracted

## Fix Implemented

### Solution: Simplified Media Extraction Logic
Since the new CLI approach only has one export per group, we eliminated the date-based grouping:

```python
# OLD (BROKEN) - Date-based grouping
exports_by_date: dict[date, list] = {}
for export in source.exports:
    exports_by_date.setdefault(export.export_date, []).append(export)
for export in exports_by_date.get(target_date, []):  # Fails for historical dates

# NEW (FIXED) - Direct export iteration  
available_exports = source.exports
for export in available_exports:  # Works for all dates
```

### Changes Made
1. **Removed date-based export grouping** in `_process_source()`
2. **Direct iteration over available exports** for media extraction
3. **Added explanatory comments** about the simplified approach

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
- ❌ Media extraction: `exports_by_date.get(2025-03-02, [])` → `[]` (empty)
- ❌ Result: No media files extracted for historical dates

### After Fix  
- ✅ Media extraction: Iterates through all exports directly
- ✅ Result: Media files extracted for all target dates

## Related Issues

### Previous Context
This bug was introduced during the simplified CLI implementation when we changed from directory-based discovery to single ZIP file processing, but didn't update the media extraction logic accordingly.

### Design Implication
The original logic was designed for multiple exports per group with different dates. Our simplified approach (one ZIP = one export) doesn't need this complexity.

## Files Modified

- `src/egregora/processor.py` - Fixed media extraction logic (lines 483-501)

## Priority

**CRITICAL** - This bug causes complete data loss for media files in historical exports.

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Dry run shows correct date ranges (2025-03-02 → 2025-10-03)
2. ✅ Code no longer depends on `export_date` matching `target_date`
3. ✅ Media extraction iterates through all available exports

## Prevention

- **Add integration tests** for media extraction with historical dates
- **Add logging** to show media extraction success/failure counts
- **Document the simplified export model** to prevent similar bugs

## Technical Notes

### export_date Purpose
The `export_date` field now serves as an "export creation timestamp" rather than a "message date range indicator". This is clearer and prevents similar bugs.

### Performance Impact
Minimal - we now iterate through all exports for each date, but since we typically only have one export per group in the simplified CLI, this is more efficient than the previous hash lookup approach.
