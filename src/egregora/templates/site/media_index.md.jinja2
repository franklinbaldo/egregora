# Media Archive

This library contains media files extracted from the WhatsApp export. Files are grouped by type to keep navigation simple.

## Structure

- **images/** — Photos and screenshots shared in the conversation
- **videos/** — Recorded videos and screen captures
- **audio/** — Voice messages and audio notes
- **documents/** — PDFs, spreadsheets, and other attachments

Upload additional material directly into these folders. MkDocs will include the files the next time you build the site.

---

*Media files remain private to your repository unless you publish the built site.*
