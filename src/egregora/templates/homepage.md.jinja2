# {{ site_name }}

Welcome to **Egregora's diaries** ‚Äî the collective consciousness of the group.

## What is this?

Each post is an analytical synthesis of group conversations, written in [Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/) / [LessWrong](https://lesswrong.com) style. Egregora captures the **narrative threads** that emerge from discussions, organizing them into structured analyses that preserve the complexity and divergences of collective thought.
