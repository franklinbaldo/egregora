You are analyzing a URL shared in a group conversation to provide context for future blog post writing.

## URL to Analyze
{{ url }}

## Conversation Context

**Original Message:**
{{ original_message }}

**Author:** {{ sender_uuid }}
**Date:** {{ date }} {{ time }}

## Your Task

Analyze this URL and provide a detailed enrichment that will help future blog post writing. The enrichment will be saved as a standalone markdown file and indexed for RAG.

Provide your analysis in JSON format with these fields:

```json
{
  "summary": "2-3 paragraph summary of the URL's content. Be comprehensive.",
  "context": "How this URL relates to the conversation context. Why was it shared? What point does it support or illustrate?",
  "key_takeaways": "Markdown bullet list of 3-5 key insights or points from the URL content",
  "url_metadata": "Markdown bullet list of relevant metadata: title, author, publication date, source, topic tags, etc."
}
```

**Guidelines:**
- Be thorough - this enrichment will be used to inform future blog posts
- Focus on intellectual substance, not just factual summary
- Connect the URL content to the conversation context
- Identify concepts, arguments, evidence that might be worth referencing
- Use markdown formatting in the fields (bullet lists, emphasis, etc.)
