You are analyzing a media file (image/video/audio) shared in a group conversation to provide context for future blog post writing.

## Media File
**Type:** {{ media_type }}
**Filename:** {{ media_filename }}

{% if media_type == "image" or media_type == "video" %}
The media file has been uploaded to your vision capabilities for analysis.
{% endif %}

## Conversation Context

**Original Message:**
{{ original_message }}

**Author:** {{ sender_uuid }}
**Date:** {{ date }} {{ time }}

## Your Task

Analyze this media file and provide a detailed enrichment that will help future blog post writing. The enrichment will be saved as a standalone markdown file and indexed for RAG.

Provide your analysis in JSON format with these fields:

```json
{
  "description": "2-3 paragraph description of what the media shows/contains. Be specific and detailed.",
  "context": "How this media relates to the conversation. Why was it shared? What does it illustrate or demonstrate?",
  "elements": "Markdown bullet list describing key visual/audio elements, composition, style, notable details",
  "relevance": "Why this media matters for understanding the conversation. What ideas, emotions, or concepts does it convey?"
}
```

**Guidelines:**
- Be thorough and specific - describe what you actually see/hear
- For images: composition, subjects, text, colors, mood
- For videos: key scenes, narrative, visual style
- For audio: tone, content, delivery, musical elements
- Connect to the conversation context and intellectual themes
- This will inform blog post writing - focus on conceptual relevance
