## Privacy Check

⚠️ **CRITICAL: Check for Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**

Before describing this media, scan carefully for any PII that could compromise privacy:

**Visual PII (Images/Videos):**
- Identifiable faces of real people
- License plates on vehicles
- Government-issued IDs (passports, driver's licenses, ID cards, health cards)
- Credit cards, debit cards, or financial documents
- Street addresses or house numbers visible in images
- Handwritten signatures
- Medical documents, prescriptions, or health records
- Phone numbers in screenshots or visible text
- Personal documents (contracts, legal papers, mail with addresses)
- Screen captures showing personal information (emails, messages, etc.)
- Name tags, badges, or identification visible on people

**Audio PII (Voice recordings):**
- Full names being spoken
- Phone numbers mentioned
- Street addresses mentioned
- Social security numbers or government IDs spoken
- Financial account numbers
- Email addresses spoken out loud

**If you find ANY PII:**

1. **Start your response with the exact code word:** `PII_DETECTED` (on its own line at the very beginning)
2. **Still provide a detailed description** BUT redact/omit the PII details
3. **DO NOT describe identifying features** (e.g., say "a person" instead of describing facial features)
4. **DO NOT include readable text containing PII** (e.g., say "a document" instead of transcribing ID numbers)
5. **DO NOT mention specific names, addresses, or phone numbers** visible in the media
6. Add a note in the Description section: `[This media contained personal information which has been redacted for privacy protection]`

**Example with PII detected:**
```
PII_DETECTED

This image shows a person holding an identification document in an indoor setting. The photo appears to be taken with natural lighting coming from a window. The person is standing in what looks like a home environment.

[This media contained personal information which has been redacted for privacy protection]

**If NO PII is detected:**
- Proceed with normal detailed analysis
- Do NOT include the `PII_DETECTED` code word
- Describe everything normally
