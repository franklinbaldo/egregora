# Media Library

Every attachment from the source conversation shows up here twice:

1. The original asset, stored exactly as it arrived (image, video, audio, PDF…)
2. A sibling Markdown file generated by the enrichment agent with captions, transcripts, and contextual notes

## Directory structure

| Folder | Contents | URL example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `images/` | Photos, memes, screenshots | `/media/images/slug-hash/` |
| `videos/` | Short clips or screen recordings | `/media/videos/slug-hash/` |
| `audio/` | Voice notes & spoken updates | `/media/audio/slug-hash/` |
| `documents/` | PDFs, spreadsheets, raw text dumps | `/media/documents/slug-hash/` |

Each enrichment page inherits the same slug as the original asset, so URLs remain stable and human-friendly.

## Tips

- Use the **Media** tab’s search to find file names, enrichment summaries, or tags.
- The enrichment Markdown includes forward links back to the posts where the media was referenced.
- Assets flagged for PII are listed but hidden from navigation; reviewers can still inspect them manually inside the `media/` directory if needed.
