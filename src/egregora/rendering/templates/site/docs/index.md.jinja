<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-post-outline:{ .lg } **Conversation Posts**

    Discover fully polished essays generated from chat windows. Each article preserves the emotional texture and references of the original conversation.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Read posts]({{ blog_dir }}/index.md)

-   :material-account-group:{ .lg } **Participant Profiles**

    Anonymized dossiers summarizing each contributor's style, recurring themes, and intellectual habits. Useful when attributing ideas without breaking privacy.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: View profiles](profiles/index.md)

-   :material-image-multiple:{ .lg } **Media Library**

    Every photo, video, or audio clip pulled from the chat with enrichment Markdown that explains what’s inside—ideal for quickly referencing context.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Browse media](media/index.md)

-   :material-notebook-edit:{ .lg } **Operational Journal**

    Daily run reports showing how the pipeline reasoned, which tools it invoked, and where enrichment succeeded or failed.

## How it works

1. **Parse & anonymize** – Exports are parsed with deterministic UUIDs so no real names reach the LLMs.
2. **Enrich everything** – URLs and media go through Pydantic-AI agents that summarize, caption, and tag assets (with human-readable slugs for URLs).
3. **Write with intent** – The writer agent produces first-person essays with clear slugs, summaries, and author metadata.
4. **Publish via MkDocs** – Every document (posts, profiles, enrichments, journals) becomes a `Document` that adapters store and link consistently.

### House style

- Conversational voice inspired by [Scott Alexander](https://slatestarcodex.com/) and [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/)
- Transparent reasoning: hooks + tension + resolution
- Privacy-first: no real names, no private timestamps
