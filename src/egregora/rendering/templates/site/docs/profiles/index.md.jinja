# Participant Profiles

> Every contributor is represented by a deterministic UUID (e.g. `23e57074`) to keep privacy intact while still letting the writer agent reference recurring voices.

## Reading profiles

- **Style overview** – High-level notes about cadence, tone, and argumentative habits
- **Topic orbit** – Subjects the participant consistently gravitates toward
- **Recent contributions** – Links to posts where that UUID made a visible impact

All of this text is generated automatically after each pipeline run, so expect it to evolve as new behavior emerges.

## Choosing an alias

Want something more memorable than a UUID?

1. In your chat, send `/egregora set alias "Your Chosen Name"`
2. Optionally add `/egregora set bio "One-line description"`
3. Regenerate the blog; your profile will now reflect the alias while still keeping the real identity private.

Need to disappear entirely? Use `/egregora opt-out` before the next run.
