# Participant Profiles

> Every contributor is represented by a **deterministic UUID** to preserve privacy while enabling the AI to track recurring voices and writing styles.

## How Profiles Work

### What's In a Profile?

- **Style overview** – Cadence, tone, and argumentative habits
- **Topic orbit** – Subjects the participant consistently gravitates toward
- **Recent contributions** – Links to posts where this UUID had visible impact

All profile text is **generated automatically** after each pipeline run, so it evolves as new behavior emerges.

### Choosing an Alias

Want something more memorable than a UUID?

```bash
# In your chat, send:
/egregora set alias "Your Chosen Name"

# Optionally add a bio:
/egregora set bio "One-line description"
```

After the next pipeline run, your profile will reflect the alias while keeping your real identity private.

### Privacy Controls

Need to disappear entirely?

```bash
/egregora opt-out
```

Run this command **before** the next ingestion. All your messages will be excluded from processing.

*Profiles refresh with every ingestion window. No manual edits needed.*
