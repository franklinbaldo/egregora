# About Our Memories

## What is this place?

This archive is more than just a chat history. It is a living storybook of our conversations, preserved forever.

Using private artificial intelligence, Egregora transforms our daily messages into a beautiful, searchable collection of stories. It doesn't just copy the text—it reads, understands, and remembers, helping us find the moments that matter most.

1. **Preserves** our shared history
2. **Connects** related conversations over time
3. **Celebrates** the unique personalities of everyone involved
4. **Protects** our privacy by running entirely on your computer

## How does it work?

### Turning Chats into Stories

Instead of making you scroll through thousands of messages, Egregora organizes our history into chapters.

- **It Remembers**: When we talk about a topic we discussed months ago, the system links the new conversation to the old one.
- **It Discovers**: It highlights the most meaningful, funny, or important moments so they don't get lost in the noise.
- **It Learns**: Over time, it learns our inside jokes, our writing styles, and what matters to us.

### Privacy First

Your memories belong to you.

- **Locally Processed**: Your conversations are processed right here on this computer. They are never uploaded to a public server or sold to advertisers.
- **Private Identities**: By default, real names are hidden from the AI to protect everyone's privacy.
- **You are in Control**: You can choose to use aliases or opt-out completely at any time.

## A Note on the AI

The stories and profiles here are generated by an AI assistant (Gemini). While it tries its best to be accurate and capturing the spirit of our talks, it might sometimes miss a nuance or misinterpret a joke—just like a human friend might!
