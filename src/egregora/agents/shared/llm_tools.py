"""Shared LLM tools for agents.

This module previously contained agent tools but they are no longer used.
The module is kept as a placeholder for future agent tool implementations.
"""

# NOTE: This file previously contained unused stub functions:
# - query_rag, ask_llm, finish, diversity_sampler, link_rewriter
# These were removed during cleanup as they were never used by any CLI command.
# RAG functionality is implemented in agents.writer.context_builder instead.
