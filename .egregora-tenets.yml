tenets:
  no-compat: "No backwards compatibility layers or shims."
  clean: "Code must be simple, readable, and minimal."
  no-defensive: "Do not guard against impossible states; rely on types/tests."
  propagate-errors: "Do not swallow errors; let them bubble to boundaries."
  strict-typing: >
    Enforce 100% static typing via mypy + pytest. Add concrete annotations,
    replace implicit Any with named aliases (no nested literals), and keep the
    typing guard in CI. See docs/mypy_enforcement_plan.md for the detailed steps.
