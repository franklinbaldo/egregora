id = "create-missing-css-file"
title = "Create missing 'extra.css' to enable custom styling"
description = """
**WHY**: The `mkdocs.yml` configuration references a custom stylesheet at `stylesheets/extra.css`, but this file is never created during the scaffolding process. This is a high-priority blocker because it prevents ANY custom styling improvements from being implemented. All other visual design tasks depend on this file existing.

**WHAT**: The scaffolding process needs to create an empty `docs/stylesheets/extra.css` file within the generated demo site.

**HOW**:
1. Modify the scaffolding logic in `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/scaffolding.py`.
2. Add a step to create the `docs/stylesheets/` directory.
3. Add a step to create an empty `extra.css` file inside that directory.

**VERIFY**:
- Run `uv run egregora demo`.
- Verify that `demo/docs/stylesheets/extra.css` exists.
- The `mkdocs build` command should complete without warnings about missing stylesheets.

id = "design-custom-color-palette"
title = "Replace generic Teal/Amber palette with a custom theme"
description = """
**WHY**: The current blog uses the default "teal" primary and "amber" accent colors from the Material for MkDocs theme. This makes the site look generic and indistinguishable from thousands of other sites using the same theme. A custom color palette is essential for establishing a unique brand identity that reflects Egregora's concept of a "collective consciousness."

**WHAT**: This is a two-part task:
1.  **Curator**: Design a professional, accessible color palette (primary, accent, light/dark mode variants).
2.  **Forge**: Implement the new palette in the `mkdocs.yml` template.

**HOW**:
1.  (Curator) I will research color theory related to community, intelligence, and reflection, and propose a new palette in `docs/ux-vision.md`.
2.  (Forge) Once the palette is defined, update the `theme.palette` section in the `mkdocs.yml.jinja` template located within `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/scaffolding.py`.

**VERIFY**:
- The generated `demo/.egregora/mkdocs.yml` should contain the new color codes.
- The served site should visually display the new primary and accent colors.
- All text must maintain a WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1) against the new background colors.

id = "add-custom-favicon"
title = "Add a custom favicon to the site"
description = """
**WHY**: The site currently lacks a favicon. This results in a generic browser icon being displayed in tabs, bookmarks, and mobile home screen shortcuts, which appears unprofessional and harms brand recognition.

**WHAT**: A custom favicon set (including `favicon.ico`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, and manifest icons) needs to be designed and integrated into the site.

**HOW**:
1.  (Curator) I will design a simple, recognizable icon for Egregora.
2.  (Forge) The icon files should be added to the `docs/assets/` directory during scaffolding.
3.  The `mkdocs.yml.jinja` template in `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/scaffolding.py` must be updated to include the `theme.favicon` and `extra.manifest` configurations pointing to the new assets.

**VERIFY**:
- After generation, the `demo/docs/assets/` directory should contain the favicon files.
- The generated `mkdocs.yml` should have the correct paths configured.
- When serving the site, the custom favicon should appear in the browser tab.

id = "remove-analytics-placeholder"
title = "Remove placeholder Google Analytics key"
description = """
**WHY**: The generated `mkdocs.yml` includes a Google Analytics property with the placeholder value `__GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_KEY__`. This is problematic for two reasons: 1) It's a broken feature that will never be autonomously populated. 2) It conflicts with the project's stated privacy-first principles. It's better to have no analytics than a broken, non-consensual implementation.

**WHAT**: Remove the `extra.analytics` section entirely from the `mkdocs.yml.jinja` template.

**HOW**:
- Edit `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/scaffolding.py`.
- Find the `extra: analytics:` block in the Jinja template string.
- Delete the entire block.

**VERIFY**:
- Run `uv run egregora demo`.
- Inspect `demo/.egregora/mkdocs.yml`.
- The `extra.analytics` section should be completely absent.

id = "improve-empty-state"
title = "Improve the 'No posts yet' empty state messaging"
description = """
**WHY**: The current empty state on the homepage (`index.md`) says 'No posts yet. Run `egregora write`'. This is functional but cold and overly technical for a potential reader. The first impression should be more welcoming and engaging.

**WHAT**: Revise the empty state message to be more user-friendly and visually interesting.

**HOW**:
- This message is generated in `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/site_generator.py` in the `get_site_stats` function which is then used to render the index page.
- The logic should be updated to return a more welcoming markdown string. For example:
  \"\"\"
  # Welcome to Our Collective Journal

  This space is quiet for now, but soon it will be filled with thoughts and ideas.

  *Content is currently being generated. Please check back soon!*
  \"\"\"

**VERIFY**:
- Generate a demo site with no posts.
- The `demo/docs/index.md` file should contain the new, more welcoming message.

id = "develop-ux-vision"
title = "Flesh out docs/ux-vision.md with a full design system"
description = """
**WHY**: The current `ux-vision.md` is minimal, only covering the template architecture. To ensure consistency and quality as the project grows, a more comprehensive design system needs to be documented.

**WHAT**: Expand `docs/ux-vision.md` to include sections on:
- Color Palette
- Typography Scale
- Spacing System
- Component Design (e.g., cards, headers)
- Accessibility Guidelines

**HOW**: I will incrementally add to this document as I make design decisions for other tasks (like the color palette). This is an ongoing, living document.

**VERIFY**: The `docs/ux-vision.md` file becomes more comprehensive over time.
