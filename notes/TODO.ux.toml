id = "missing-custom-css"
title = "Create missing custom CSS file"
description = """
WHY: The mkdocs.yml references 'stylesheets/extra.css' but the file doesn't exist.
This causes a 404 error and prevents custom styling from being applied.

WHAT: Create demo/docs/stylesheets/extra.css with baseline UX improvements:
- Optimal line length (65-75 characters for body text)
- Improved heading hierarchy (clear visual distinction)
- Better spacing between elements (consistent 8px grid)
- Enhanced readability (increased line-height for body text)

HOW TO VERIFY:
- File exists at demo/docs/stylesheets/extra.css
- No 404 errors in browser console
- Line length limited to 65-75 characters
- Visual hierarchy clear at a glance

id = "generic-color-palette"
title = "Replace generic teal/amber color palette with distinctive brand colors"
description = """
WHY: The current teal/amber palette is Material Design's default and doesn't
create a distinctive brand identity. A thoughtful color palette improves recognition
and creates emotional connection with readers.

WHAT: Design and implement a custom color palette that:
- Reflects the "collective consciousness" theme (consider: deep blue/purple for thought, warm orange/gold for connection)
- Maintains WCAG AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum for body text)
- Works well in both light and dark modes
- Uses 3-5 purposeful colors maximum

HOW TO VERIFY:
- Color palette is unique and not default Material colors
- All text has >=4.5:1 contrast ratio (test with WebAIM tool)
- Palette documented in docs/ux-vision.md
- Colors feel cohesive and intentional

WHERE:
- Configuration: demo/.egregora/mkdocs.yml (theme.palette section)

id = "missing-favicon"
title = "Add custom favicon and branding"
description = """
WHY: Favicon is a critical branding touchpoint visible in browser tabs, bookmarks,
and mobile home screens. Missing favicon makes the site look unfinished and unprofessional.

WHAT: Design and add a custom favicon that:
- Represents "collective consciousness" or "egregora" concept
- Works at 16x16, 32x32, and 180x180 sizes (SVG preferred)
- Includes apple-touch-icon for iOS
- Matches the site's color palette

HOW TO VERIFY:
- Favicon visible in browser tab
- Apple touch icon works on iOS (180x180)
- Icon is distinctive and recognizable at small sizes
- SVG or multiple PNG sizes provided

WHERE:
- Files: demo/docs/assets/images/ (favicon.svg, apple-touch-icon.png)

id = "analytics-placeholder"
title = "Remove or configure Google Analytics placeholder"
description = """
WHY: The mkdocs.yml contains a placeholder Google Analytics key ("__GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_KEY__")
which doesn't work and may cause JavaScript errors. This is either unused or incorrectly configured.

WHAT: Either:
A) Remove analytics section entirely (recommended for privacy-first blog)
B) Make analytics optional and document how users can enable it
C) Use privacy-preserving alternative (Plausible, Umami)

HOW TO VERIFY:
- No "__GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_KEY__" placeholder in config
- No JavaScript errors related to analytics
- If analytics enabled, privacy policy documented
- User can easily opt out

WHERE:
- Config: demo/.egregora/mkdocs.yml (extra.analytics section)

id = "empty-state-messaging"
title = "Improve empty state messaging when no posts exist"
description = """
WHY: When the site is first generated or API fails, users see "No posts yet. Run egregora write"
which is helpful but could be more engaging and provide clearer next steps.

WHAT: Enhanced empty state that:
- Explains what will appear here (examples of post types)
- Provides clear next steps (command to run, expected wait time)
- Maintains encouraging tone (not just an error message)
- Shows visual placeholder (maybe illustration or icon)

HOW TO VERIFY:
- Message is clear and actionable
- Tone is helpful, not technical/cold
- User knows exactly what to do next
- Visual element makes page feel less empty

description = """
WHY: Build log shows 404 errors for social card images (og:image for sharing on
Twitter, Facebook, etc.). These images are critical for professional sharing.

WHAT: Investigate and fix social card image generation:
- Understand why social plugin can't find images
- Ensure images are generated correctly
- Verify og:image meta tags are correct
- Test social sharing preview

HOW TO VERIFY:
- No 404 errors for social card images in build log
- Images accessible at expected URLs
- Twitter/Facebook preview shows correct image
- Images are visually appealing (1200x630 recommended)

id = "navigation-structure"
title = "Review and optimize navigation structure"
description = """
WHY: The navigation has only 4 items (Home, Blog, Media, About) which is good,
but "Media" at the top level may not be the best information architecture for
a blog. Media is supportive content, not primary.

WHAT: Consider restructuring navigation to:
- Keep Home and Blog as primary
- Move Media under Blog or into a separate Resources section
- Add Journal to navigation (currently missing from nav but exists in docs/)
- Ensure "You are here" indicators work correctly

HOW TO VERIFY:
- Navigation has 3-7 top-level items (currently 4 - good)
- Most important content is most accessible
- Breadcrumbs show correct path
- Mobile hamburger menu works smoothly

WHERE:
- Config: demo/.egregora/mkdocs.yml (nav section)

WHY: The site is currently named "demo" which is generic and not evocative.
A good site name creates identity and helps with recall.

WHAT: Choose a distinctive site name that:
- Reflects the "collective consciousness" theme
- Is memorable and pronounceable
- Works well in browser titles and social shares
- Avoids generic tech terms

HOW TO VERIFY:
- Site name appears in browser tab title
- Name is distinctive (not "demo", "test", "blog")
- Name documented in docs/ux-vision.md
- All pages show correct site name

WHY: The Curator persona needs a living document to track UX vision, principles,

WHAT: Create docs/ux-vision.md with:
- UX principles and philosophy
- Color palette and rationale
- Typography scale
- Spacing system
- Component decisions
- Template architecture (where source files live)

HOW TO VERIFY:

WHY: Typography is 95% of web design. A harmonious typography scale creates

- Base font size (16px recommended for readability)
- Modular scale for headings (1.25 or 1.333 ratio)
- Line heights optimized per text size (1.5 for body, tighter for headings)
- Font weights used consistently (limit to 2-3 weights)

HOW TO VERIFY:
- H1-H6 sizes follow harmonic scale
- Visual hierarchy obvious at a glance
- Line heights create good rhythm

a sign of quality.

WHAT: Investigate warnings and either:
- Fix the git configuration issue
- Disable git-revision-date-localized plugin if not needed
- Set enable_git_follow: false as suggested
