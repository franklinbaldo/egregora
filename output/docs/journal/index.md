# Operational Journals

Each processing window ends with a continuity memo authored by the writer agent. These memos capture:

- **Tool usage** – which functions were invoked, which media were enriched, and any failures encountered
- **Publishing summary** – counts of posts, profiles, and annotations created during the window
- **Forward-looking prompts** – unresolved questions or tensions the agent wants future runs to revisit

Browse the `journal/` directory in the sidebar to open individual entries. Filenames follow the creation timestamp
(`YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.md`) so the most recent memos sort naturally at the bottom.

> Journals are intentionally hidden from the top-level blog index to keep the reading experience focused on essays.
> Use this section when you want to audit how the run behaved or debug enrichment anomalies.
