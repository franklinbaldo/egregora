  # Python dependencies
  # NOTE: This project uses uv (not pip), which Dependabot doesn't support yet.
  # Dependabot will read pyproject.toml but won't update uv.lock correctly.
  #
  # Options for better dependency management:
  # 1. Use Renovate (https://docs.renovatebot.com/) - has experimental uv support
  # 2. Manually update: `uv lock --upgrade` and commit
  # 3. Wait for official Dependabot uv support (tracking: github/feedback#9)
  #
  # For now, keeping pip ecosystem enabled for pyproject.toml awareness,
  # but expect manual intervention for uv.lock updates.
