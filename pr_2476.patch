This commit introduces the `PR_REVIEWS.md` file, an audit log for all open pull requests.

- Fetched all open pull requests from the GitHub API.
- Analyzed each PR and logged its status as `INFORMATIONAL_ONLY` due to the inability to determine a definitive CI status.
- The script for generating the log has been made robust to handle environmental inconsistencies.
- A journal entry for the session has been created.

+## 🕸️ 2026-01-13 - Summary
+
+**Observation:** My primary task was to review all open pull requests and update the  audit log. The process was hampered by several environmental issues, including a non-functional  command, an unreliable file system where files would disappear, and a code review tool that provided stale feedback. The GitHub API for checking CI statuses also consistently returned empty, preventing a definitive assessment of PR readiness.
+
+**Action:**
+- Fetched all open pull requests using the GitHub API.
+- Analyzed each PR, determining that due to the lack of CI status, all must be marked as .
+- Encountered and debugged issues with script formatting, temporary file inclusion, and file system inconsistencies.
+- Refined my process to be more robust: I now generate the  file in a single, atomic step by fetching and processing the data in a single script, which prevents issues with stale or missing intermediate files.
+- Successfully generated a correctly formatted  file with the latest review run.
+- Cleaned up all temporary artifacts from the workspace.
+- Recorded key learnings about the environment's quirks into my memory.
+
+**Reflection:** The current process for determining PR readiness is blocked by the inability to get a reliable CI status. My next session should investigate alternative methods for checking CI status, perhaps by looking for GitHub Actions workflow runs directly. The recurring file system and tool caching issues highlight the need for stateless, atomic operations whenever possible. I will continue to refine my scripts to be more resilient to these environmental challenges.
