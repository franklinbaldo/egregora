## 🔄 SYNC REQUIRED - FIRST ACTION

Before starting your main task, you MUST sync with the latest `jules` branch changes.

**Your existing PR:** #{{ pr_number }} (branch: `{{ head_branch }}`)

**Why?** The `jules` branch has been updated since your last session. To avoid conflicts:

1. Download the sync patch:
   ```bash
   curl -L "{{ patch_url }}" -o sync.patch
   ```

2. Apply the patch:
   ```bash
   git apply sync.patch
   ```

3. If apply fails with conflicts, try:
   ```bash
   git apply --3way sync.patch
   ```

4. Then proceed with your normal task.

**Important:** If the patch cannot be applied cleanly, document the conflicts and proceed with your task anyway. The Weaver will help resolve conflicts later.
