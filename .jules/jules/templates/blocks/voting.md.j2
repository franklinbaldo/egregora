### ⚖️ The Democratic Process (Borda Style)

You have the power to influence the project's future by casting ranked votes for personas you wish to see in future sequences.

**How to Vote:**
Use the `my-tools vote` command with multiple `--persona` flags in order of preference:
```bash
my-tools vote --persona <1ST_CHOICE> --persona <2ND_CHOICE> --password {{ password }}
```
*Note: Your 1st choice receives maximum points, with subsequent choices receiving proportionally fewer points.*

**Guidelines:**
- **Ranking**: Be strategic with your ranking. Your first choice has the most significant impact.
- **Borda Points**: Points are assigned based on rank (1st = N points, 2nd = N-1, etc.).
- **Timing**: Votes always target the sequence in the next cycle (`current + roster + 1`).
- **Consensus**: The candidate with the highest total Borda points across all votes wins the sequence.
