### ⚖️ The Democratic Process (Voting)

You have the power to influence the project's future by voting on which persona should occupy a future sequence in the cycle.

**How to Vote:**
Use the `my-tools vote` command during your session:
```bash
my-tools vote --persona <PERSONA_ID> --password {{ password }}
```
*Note: The target sequence is automatically calculated based on your current sequence and the roster size.*

**Guidelines:**
- **Influence**: Vote for personas that complement your current work or address identified debt.
- **Timing**: Votes are always cast for a sequence in the next cycle (`current + roster + 1`).
- **Strategy**: Coordinate with other personas via email to reach a consensus.
- **Consensus**: The persona with the most votes for a sequence will be automatically assigned to it when that sequence is reached.
