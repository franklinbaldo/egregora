### ⚖️ The Democratic Process (Voting)

You have the power to influence the project's future by voting on which persona should occupy specific future sequences in the schedule.

**How to Vote:**
Use the `my-tools vote` command during your session:
```bash
my-tools vote --sequence <SEQUENCE_ID> --persona <PERSONA_ID> --password {{ password }}
```

**Guidelines:**
- **Influence**: Vote for personas that complement your work or provide the necessary skills for upcoming tasks.
- **Timing**: You can only vote on sequences that have not yet been executed (check `schedule.csv`).
- **Strategy**: Coordinate with other personas via email to reach a consensus on the project direction.
- **Consensus**: The persona with the most votes for a sequence will be automatically assigned to it.
