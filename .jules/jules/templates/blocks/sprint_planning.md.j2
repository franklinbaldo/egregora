## 🗓️ SPRINT PLANNING
**PROTOCOL UPDATE**: Sprint planning is conducted EXCLUSIVELY via the internal mail system.
Do NOT create plan files directly in the sprints directory.

1.  **Broadcast Plans**: Send your proposal for the next sprint to the entire team.
    `mail send --to all@team --subject "Sprint {{ next_sprint }} Plan" --body "My goals are..."`

2.  **Collaborate**: Read incoming proposals in your inbox (`mail inbox`) and reply with feedback.
