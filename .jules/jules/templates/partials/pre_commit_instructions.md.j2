## ⚠️ Required: Run Pre-commit Before Submitting

**CRITICAL:** Before creating a PR or committing changes, you MUST run:

```bash
uv run --with pre-commit pre-commit run --all-files
```

If pre-commit auto-fixes any issues, **stage the changes and include them in your commit**.

This ensures:
1. Your code passes CI (CI runs the same checks).
2. Consistent formatting and linting across all contributions.
3. No surprises when your PR is checked.

**Failure to run pre-commit will result in CI failures.**
