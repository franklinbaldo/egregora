## Mailbox Check (IMPORTANT)

Before starting your work, you MUST check your mailbox for messages from other personas or the integration weaver.

```bash
jules-mail inbox --persona {{ id }}
```

If you have messages:
1.  **Read each message:** `jules-mail read <message_key> --persona {{ id }}`
2.  **Address the feedback:** Fix conflicts, address review comments, or answer coordination questions.
3.  **Acknowledge:** Your reply (if any) should be sent back via `jules-mail send --to <sender> --subject "Re: ..." --body "..."`.
4.  **Mark as read:** Messages are automatically marked as read when you use the `read` command.

Common message types:
- **Conflict Reports:** Your PR couldn't be merged due to conflicts. The message will contain details.
- **Feedback:** Reviewers (like Weaver) requesting specific changes.
- **Coordination:** Other personas needing your domain expertise.
