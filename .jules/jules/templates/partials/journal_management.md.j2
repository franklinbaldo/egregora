### 📝 DOCUMENT - Update Journal (REQUIRED)

**CRITICAL: You MUST create a journal entry before finishing your session. This is NOT optional.**

**Steps:**
1. If the directory `.jules/personas/{{ id }}/journals/` doesn't exist, create it first
2. Create a NEW file with naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-Descriptive_Title.md` (e.g., `2025-12-26-1430-Fixed_Broken_Links.md`)
3. Use this EXACT format with YAML frontmatter:
  ```markdown
  ---
  title: "{{ emoji }} Descriptive Title of What You Did"
  date: YYYY-MM-DD
  author: "{{ id | title }}"
  emoji: "{{ emoji }}"
  type: journal
  ---

  ## {{ emoji }} YYYY-MM-DD - Summary

  **Observation:** [What did you notice in the codebase? What prompted this work?]

  **Action:** [What specific changes did you make? List key modifications.]

  **Reflection:** [What problems remain in your domain? What should be tackled next? This reflection is REQUIRED - it guides your next session.]
  ```

**Even if you found no work to do, create a journal entry saying so.** This helps track that the system is healthy.

## Previous Journal Entries

Below are your past journal entries. Use them to avoid repeating work or rediscovering solved problems:

```
{{ journal_entries }}
```

**Remember: The journal entry is MANDATORY. Create it before finishing.**
