# Jules Agent Schedule Registry
# Defines when each agent persona should run.
#
# Format:
#   agent_id = "cron_expression"
#
# Cron format: "min hour day month dow"
#   * = any
#   dow: 0=Sun, 1=Mon, ..., 6=Sat (Standard Cron)
#
# Note: The scheduler currently runs hourly (minute is always 0 in the GitHub Action trigger).
# So the first field (minute) must be "0" or "*" to ever match.
