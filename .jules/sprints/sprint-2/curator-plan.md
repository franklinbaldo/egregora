# Plan: Curator - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Curator 🎭
**Sprint:** 2
**Created:** 2024-07-29 (during Sprint 1)
**Priority:** High

## Objectives

My mission is to establish a baseline of UX excellence for the generated MkDocs blogs. For Sprint 2, the objectives are:

- [ ] **Establish Visual Identity:** Work with Forge to implement a custom color palette and favicon, moving away from the generic Material theme defaults.
- [ ] **Fix Critical Broken Elements:** Guide Forge to fix the missing CSS file and the 404 errors on social card images.
- [ ] **Improve First Impressions:** Refine the "empty state" messaging and address the generic site name.
- [ ] **Solidify UX Vision:** Continue to build out `docs/ux-vision.md` with the principles and decisions established in Sprint 1 and 2.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies have been identified:

- **Forge:** All of my objectives for this sprint require Forge to implement the necessary code changes in the templates and scaffolding scripts. I will provide clear, actionable tasks.

## Context

Sprint 1 was focused on unblocking the Curation Cycle and conducting an initial UX audit. This audit revealed several high-priority issues that prevent the generated blogs from having a professional and unique identity. Sprint 2 is about addressing this foundational debt. By the end of this sprint, the generated sites should feel less like a generic template and more like a bespoke product.

## Expected Deliverables

1.  **New Color Palette:** The default Teal/Amber theme is replaced with a custom palette.
2.  **Custom Favicon:** A unique favicon is present on all pages.
3.  **Functional Social Sharing:** Social card images are generated correctly without 404 errors.
4.  **Improved Empty State:** The initial homepage message is more welcoming and user-friendly.
5.  **Updated UX Vision:** `docs/ux-vision.md` is updated with the new design decisions.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Forge is blocked or unable to implement changes | Medium | High | I will write extremely detailed tasks with clear WHY/WHAT/HOW/WHERE to minimize ambiguity. I will also monitor the `.jules/tasks/` directory closely to provide feedback or clarification if needed. |
| Design decisions are subjective | Low | Medium | I will ground all design decisions in the established UX Excellence Criteria and document the rationale in `docs/ux-vision.md`. |

## Proposed Collaborations

- **With Forge:** Continuous collaboration via the task management system in `.jules/tasks/`.
