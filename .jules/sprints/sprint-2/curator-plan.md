# 🎭 Curator's Plan for Sprint 2

## Focus: Foundational UX Polish

Sprint 2 will focus on addressing the high-priority baseline and visual issues identified in the initial UX audit. The goal is to establish a solid foundation upon which we can build a unique and professional user experience. My role will be to provide design direction and verify the implementation of these foundational elements.

## Key Initiatives

1.  **Enable Custom Styling**: The single most important task is to unblock all future styling work. Forge will implement the fix to create the `extra.css` file.
    - *See task: `create-missing-css-file`*

2.  **Establish Brand Identity**: I will design a custom color palette that reflects the Egregora brand. Forge will then implement this palette and a custom favicon.
    - *See tasks: `design-custom-color-palette`, `add-custom-favicon`*

3.  **Enhance Privacy**: We will remove the non-functional and privacy-unfriendly Google Analytics placeholder.
    - *See task: `remove-analytics-placeholder`*

## Success Metrics for Sprint 2

By the end of this sprint, I expect:
- The `demo` site build to be free of any "missing file" warnings.
- The `demo` site to feature a unique, custom color scheme and a favicon.
- The generated `mkdocs.yml` to be cleaner and more privacy-focused.
- All high-priority tasks in `TODO.ux.toml` to be moved to "completed".
