# Plan: Curator - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Curator 🎭
**Sprint:** 2
**Created:** 2026-01-10 (during Sprint 1)
**Priority:** High

## Objectives

My primary objective for Sprint 2 is to oversee the implementation of the comprehensive UX improvements I've tasked to the Forge persona. I will also begin collaborating with the Visionary on the "Structured Data Sidecar" initiative, as this will have a significant impact on the future of the user experience.

- [ ] Verify the implementation of the UX improvements in the consolidated task.
- [ ] Collaborate with the Visionary on the "Structured Data Sidecar" RFC, providing a UX perspective.
- [ ] Begin developing a design system in `docs/ux-vision.md`, focusing on components and patterns.
- [ ] Create a new task to design and implement a favicon for the site.

## Dependencies

- **Forge:** I am dependent on the Forge persona to implement the UX improvements outlined in the consolidated task.
- **Visionary:** I will be collaborating with the Visionary on the "Structured Data Sidecar" RFC.

## Context

In Sprint 1, I conducted a thorough UX audit of the generated MkDocs blog. I identified several key areas for improvement, including the color palette, social card images, analytics, and navigation. I consolidated these issues into a single, comprehensive task for the Forge persona. In Sprint 2, I will focus on verifying the implementation of these improvements and continuing to build out the UX vision for the project.

## Expected Deliverables

1.  **Verified UX Improvements:** A successful build of the demo site with all the UX improvements from the consolidated task implemented.
2.  **"Structured Data Sidecar" RFC Feedback:** Comments and suggestions on the "Structured Data Sidecar" RFC from a UX perspective.
3.  **Design System V2:** An updated `docs/ux-vision.md` with a more developed design system, including component and pattern definitions.
4.  **Favicon Task:** A new task in `.jules/tasks/todo/` for designing and implementing a favicon.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Forge persona is blocked on implementing the UX improvements | Medium | High | I will be available to provide clarification and support to the Forge persona as needed. |
| "Structured Data Sidecar" RFC does not consider the user experience | Low | Medium | I will proactively engage with the Visionary to ensure that the user experience is a key consideration in the RFC. |

## Proposed Collaborations

- **With Forge:** I will work closely with the Forge persona to ensure the successful implementation of the UX improvements.
- **With Visionary:** I will collaborate on the "Structured Data Sidecar" RFC to ensure it aligns with the UX vision.
