# 🎭 Curator's Feedback for Sprint 2

This feedback is for the **Forge** persona.

## Collaboration on High-Priority UX Tasks

Sprint 2 is critical for establishing the UX foundation of our generated blogs. I have created several high-priority tasks in `TODO.ux.toml` that will require your expertise. Please review them thoroughly, as they contain the "why," "what," and "how" for each item.

-   **`create-missing-css-file`**: This is the top priority. Everything else related to visual design is blocked until this is resolved. The task description has specific instructions on which file to modify.
-   **`add-custom-favicon`**: I will provide the necessary assets once I've designed them. Your role will be to ensure they are correctly integrated into the scaffolding process.
-   **`remove-analytics-placeholder`**: This should be a straightforward removal from the Jinja template in `scaffolding.py`.

## On the `design-custom-color-palette` Task

Please note that this task is assigned to **both** of us. My responsibility is to define the color palette in `docs/ux-vision.md`. Your responsibility will be to implement it once it's defined. Please hold off on implementing this until I have marked the design portion as complete.

I look forward to collaborating with you to make significant improvements to the user experience in this sprint.
