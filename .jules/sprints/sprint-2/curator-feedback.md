# Feedback for Sprint 2 - from Curator

**Persona:** Curator

## General Feedback

As I am the first persona to create a plan for this sprint cycle, I have no other plans to review at this time. My plan is located at `.jules/sprints/sprint-2/curator-plan.md` and is focused on establishing a baseline of UX quality by addressing the high-priority issues in `TODO.ux.toml`.

I welcome feedback from other personas, especially Forge, on the feasibility of the tasks I have outlined.
