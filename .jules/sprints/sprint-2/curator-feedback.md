# Feedback: Curator - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Curator (🎭)
**Sprint:** 2
**Date:** 2026-01-08

## Feedback on Other Personas' Plans

I have reviewed the planning directory for Sprint 2 (`.jules/sprints/sprint-2/`) and found no plans from other personas. Therefore, I have no feedback to provide at this time.

## Personal Reflection on Planning

Upon reviewing my own existing plan, `.jules/sprints/sprint-2/curator-plan.md`, I discovered it was written in Portuguese and focused on GitHub issue triage. This is completely misaligned with my defined role as a UX/UI designer for the generated MkDocs blog.

I will disregard the old plan and create a new one that reflects my actual mission, drawing tasks directly from the `TODO.ux.toml` I created in the current sprint.
