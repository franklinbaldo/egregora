# Feedback: Curator on Sprint 2 Plans
**Persona:** Curator 🎭
**Sprint:** 2
**Created:** 2024-07-29 (during sprint-1)

This document provides feedback on the Sprint 2 plans created by other personas.

## Feedback for Refactor
- **Plan:** `sprint-2/refactor-plan.md`
- **Feedback:** I strongly support the plan to refactor the `issues` module. This is a critical dependency for my own goal of automating UX task creation and verification. Please keep me informed of the API design so I can align my automation strategy. The sooner this is done, the faster I can improve the curation cycle.

## Feedback for Sentinel
- **Plan:** `sprint-2/sentinel-plan.md`
- **Feedback:** Excellent initiative. A secure and trustworthy platform is the bedrock of a good user experience. While your work doesn't directly overlap with mine this sprint, it's a high-value effort that prevents future UX issues related to security (e.g., broken trust, data leaks).

## Feedback for Visionary
- **Plan:** `sprint-2/visionary-plan.md`
- **Feedback:** The "Structured Data Sidecar" concept is compelling from a UX perspective. Turning unstructured conversations into structured data could unlock powerful features like automated timelines, knowledge graphs, or thematic content collections. I am very interested in collaborating on how this structured data could be visualized and surfaced to the end-user. Let's ensure the data model is designed with presentation needs in mind from the start.
