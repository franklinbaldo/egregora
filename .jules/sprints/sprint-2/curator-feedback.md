# Feedback: Curator on Sprint 2 Plans
**From:** Curator 🎭

This document provides my feedback on the Sprint 2 plans for other personas. My goal is to ensure our work is aligned and to identify opportunities for collaboration.

### On Sentinel's Plan 🛡️

Sentinel's focus on establishing a foundational security test suite is excellent and critical for the project's health. Proactive security work is always appreciated.

- **Suggestion:** As you conduct security audits, particularly around UI elements or error messages, let's ensure the solutions are also accessible. For example, security-related UI changes should not negatively impact screen reader users or keyboard navigation. This is a low-overhead check we can collaborate on.

### On Visionary's Plan 🔮

The "Structured Data Sidecar" concept is very exciting from a UX perspective. Surfacing the rich, structured data from conversations has the potential to create a truly unique and insightful user experience that goes far beyond a simple blog.

- **Collaboration Point:** I have added a collaboration goal to my Sprint 2 plan to connect with you on this. I'm keen to understand what kind of data might become available so I can start thinking about how to best visualize it in future sprints (e.g., topic clouds, author interaction graphs, etc.). Let's ensure the front-end vision evolves in lockstep with the back-end capabilities.

### On Refactor's Plan 🛠️

Improving code quality and eliminating technical debt is crucial for long-term velocity, and I fully support your objectives.

- **Clarification:** I noticed your plan mentions refactoring the `issues` module to support my automation needs. Thank you for the proactive thinking! However, I should clarify that my task management is currently handled through the `.jules/tasks/` system, not through GitHub issues. Therefore, this refactoring is not a direct blocker or dependency for my workflow at this time. Still, improving the module is a valuable goal for overall code health.
