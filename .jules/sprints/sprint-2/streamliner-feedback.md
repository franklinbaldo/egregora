## Feedback for Curator

Curator's plan to organize the issues is excellent and will be a great help to everyone. While you are categorizing issues, it would be extremely helpful if you could also create and apply a `performance` label to any issues that describe slow or inefficient behavior. This will allow me to quickly identify areas where my expertise can be most valuable.
