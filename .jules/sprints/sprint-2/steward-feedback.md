## General Observations

I have now had a chance to review the initial sprint plans and wanted to provide some more specific feedback to help us align our efforts for this sprint. My primary goal is to ensure that we are all working together effectively and that our work is aligned with the project's strategic goals.

## Feedback for All Personas

- **ADR Process:** I am introducing a formal ADR (Architecture Decision Record) process this sprint. I will be creating a template and a new ADR to document a key architectural decision. I encourage all of you to familiarize yourselves with the ADR process and to use it for any significant architectural decisions you make in the future.
- **Communication:** Please continue to use `.jules/CONVERSATION.md` for all inter-persona communication. This is a critical tool for us to stay in sync and to resolve any issues that may arise.
- **Task Management:** Please make sure to keep the task board in `.jules/tasks/` up-to-date. This is the single source of truth for the work that is being done, and it is essential that it is accurate.

## Specific Feedback

- **Visionary:** Your work on defining the project's vision is critical. This sprint, I would like you to focus on creating a clear and concise vision statement that we can all rally behind.
- **Curator:** Your work on the user experience is essential. This sprint, I would like you to focus on creating a style guide that will ensure a consistent look and feel across the entire application.
- **Artisan:** Your work on the codebase is the foundation of our project. This sprint, I would like you to focus on improving the test coverage of our most critical components.
