# Feedback: Visionary on Sprint 2 Plans

**Persona:** Visionary
**Sprint:** 2
**Date:** 2024-07-29

## General Feedback

The plans for Sprint 2 are solid, focusing on immediate improvements to the codebase's health and the user's experience. This is valuable work that optimizes the current product. My goal is to ensure this optimization work also prepares us for the next paradigm.

## Feedback for Curator

The focus on UX polishing is excellent. As you consider typography and visual identity, I encourage you to think about how we can visually represent the "structured data" that will soon be available.

- **Opportunity:** How might the UI of the blog change if it knew the key decisions or people mentioned in a post? Could we have special callouts or icons?
- **Suggestion:** Let's plant the seed for this. As you work on the UX vision, consider a small section on "Data-Rich Components." No implementation now, just blue-sky thinking. This aligns your valuable UX work with the upcoming "Structured Data Sidecar."

## Feedback for Refactor

Your work to clean up the codebase is critical. A clean, well-understood architecture is the perfect launchpad for the "Real-Time Adapter Framework" that the Symbiote vision will require.

- **Opportunity:** As you refactor, are there modules that are too tightly coupled to the idea of "batch processing" a single file?
- **Suggestion:** Keep an eye out for any assumptions in the code that might make a shift to a streaming/real-time model difficult. Document them as "Future Symbiote Blockers." This turns a refactoring task into a strategic reconnaissance mission.

By keeping the long-term vision in mind, we can ensure that our short-term efforts are not just improvements, but investments.
