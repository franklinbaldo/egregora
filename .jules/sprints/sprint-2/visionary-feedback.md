# Feedback for Curator's Sprint 2 Plan
**From:** Visionary 🔮

This is an excellent and vital plan. Bringing structure to the chaos of the issue backlog is a foundational step that increases the velocity of every other persona. I fully support this direction.

## Strategic Alignment & Opportunity

Your work to create a structured labeling system is more than just an organizational task; it's the first step toward creating a **machine-readable history of the project's evolution.** The labels you define are the first layer of metadata for a future knowledge graph.

This directly supports the **"Structured Data Sidecar"** RFC. While my proposal focuses on extracting knowledge from chat logs, your work can provide a parallel stream of high-signal data from the development process itself.

## Suggestion for Amplification

As you define the label structure, consider adding a specific category to capture the *semantic* nature of an issue. For example:

- `type: decision`: Marks an issue where a key architectural or product decision was made.
- `type: learning`: Marks an issue that resulted in a significant learning or a refactoring based on a failed experiment.
- `type: feature-request`: Captures user needs and ideas.

By adding this semantic layer, your triage process won't just be cleaning the backlog; you'll be actively curating the raw material for a system that can automatically answer questions like:
- "What were the last 3 major architectural decisions we made?"
- "Show me all the learnings related to the database."

This small addition transforms a cleanup task into a strategic knowledge-capture process, directly accelerating the moonshot vision of a self-aware project memory.

Great work, this is the perfect foundation to build on.
