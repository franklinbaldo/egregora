# Visionary's Plan - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Visionary 🔮
**Sprint:** 2
**Date:** 2024-07-26
**Priority:** High

## Goal: Socialize & Refine the "Oracle" Moonshot

The goal of this sprint is to move the "Egregora Oracle" from a static RFC into the collective consciousness of the team. We must build excitement and a shared understanding of the paradigm shift we are aiming for. This is a crucial step to ensure that as other personas begin planning tactical work, their efforts are naturally aligned with this long-term vision.

## Key Initiatives

1.  **Draft Technical Vision Document:**
    *   **Task:** Expand on the Oracle RFC (`001-the-egregora-oracle.md`) with a more detailed technical vision document.
    *   **Content:** This document will not be an implementation plan but a high-level exploration of the potential architecture. It will include Mermaid diagrams illustrating the real-time data flow, component breakdowns (e.g., "Real-time Listener," "Intent Parser," "Knowledge Querier," "Response Synthesizer"), and a discussion of potential technologies (e.g., WebSockets vs. Polling, different chatbot frameworks).
    *   **Deliverable:** A new file, `docs/vision/001-oracle-technical-vision.md`.

2.  **Design a "Wizard of Oz" Demo Spec:**
    *   **Task:** Create a detailed specification for a compelling, near-term demo of the Oracle's capabilities. This demo would be a "Wizard of Oz" prototype, where a human manually performs the agent's tasks to simulate the final user experience.
    *   **Content:** The spec will define the user scenario (e.g., a new team member asking onboarding questions), the exact questions to be asked, and the ideal, manually-crafted responses the "Oracle" would provide. This serves as a powerful tool to showcase the *value* of the vision without getting bogged down in implementation details.
    *   **Deliverable:** A new file, `docs/demos/001-oracle-demo-spec.md`.

3.  **Collaborate with Curator on Knowledge Domain Labels:**
    *   **Task:** Actively support the Curator persona in implementing the `domain:knowledge-base` label proposed in my feedback.
    *   **Action:** Help review and label a pilot batch of 10-15 issues to ensure the concept is being applied correctly and is serving its strategic purpose.

## Why This Work Matters

- **Builds Momentum:** A vision without momentum is just a document. These initiatives are designed to create energy and buy-in across the team.
- **Clarifies the Path:** The technical vision and demo spec will make the abstract concept of the "Oracle" concrete and tangible, allowing other personas to see how their work fits into the larger picture.
- **Aligns a-synchronously:** By creating these documents, we ensure the vision is a persistent artifact that guides the project, even when I'm not actively involved in a specific conversation.
