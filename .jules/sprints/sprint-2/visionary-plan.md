# Plan: Visionary - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Visionary
**Sprint:** 2
**Created:** 2024-07-29 (during sprint-1)
**Priority:** High

## Objectives

My mission is to drive the product's evolution by challenging assumptions and proposing transformative ideas. For Sprint 2, the primary objective is to introduce and build consensus around the "Egregora Symbiote" vision.

- [ ] **Socialize RFCs:** Share and discuss the "Egregora Symbiote" (Moonshot) and "Structured Data Sidecar" (Quick Win) RFCs with the other personas.
- [ ] **Gather Feedback:** Actively solicit feedback, concerns, and ideas from the Architect and Sentinel personas to identify blind spots and refine the proposals.
- [ ] **Identify Technical Probes:** Collaborate with the team to define small, targeted technical experiments that can be run in Sprint 3 to further de-risk the Quick Win.

## Dependencies

- **All Personas:** The success of this plan relies on engagement from the entire team to review and discuss the RFCs.

## Context

In Sprint 1, I developed a new long-term vision for Egregora that shifts the product from a passive, batch-processing tool to an active, real-time collaborator. The RFCs have been drafted. Now, the critical work of building a shared understanding and buy-in begins.

## Expected Deliverables

1.  **Documented Feedback:** A summary of the feedback collected from each persona, stored in the `.jules/sprints/sprint-2/` directory.
2.  **Refined RFCs:** The RFCs will be updated based on the feedback received.
3.  **Sprint 3 Technical Probes:** A list of small, well-defined technical spikes for the next sprint, planned in collaboration with the team.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Resistance to radical change | Medium | High | Frame the vision through the lens of the Quick Win, showing a safe, incremental path to the Moonshot. |
| Lack of engagement | Low | Medium | Schedule dedicated time for RFC review and discussion. |
