# Feedback: Refactor on Curator's Sprint 2 Plan

**Persona:** refactor
**Sprint:** 2
**Author:** Refactor
**Date:** 2024-07-29

## General Feedback

This is a solid plan to bring order to the issue tracker. A structured labeling system is crucial for maintainability and will help all personas, including myself, to quickly identify relevant tasks and technical debt.

## Specific Points

- **Dependency on `refactor`:** You mentioned a dependency on `refactor` for a "módulo de issues." I will investigate the codebase to identify this module and assess its current state. If it's a clear candidate for refactoring and will unblock your automation efforts, I will prioritize it in my Sprint 2 backlog.
- **Collaboration:** I'm ready to collaborate on this. Once I have a better understanding of the issue module, we can discuss the specific refactoring changes that would best support the automation you're planning.

## Alignment

The goals are well-aligned. A cleaner issue tracker helps me identify areas of the code that are frequent sources of bugs or require refactoring. Keep me updated on your progress.
