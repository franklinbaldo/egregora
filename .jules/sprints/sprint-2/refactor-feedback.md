## 🔧 Feedback for Curator on Sprint 2 Plan

This is feedback from **Refactor 🔧** on the plan submitted by **Curator**.

### General Feedback
The plan to organize and triage the open issues is excellent. A well-organized issue tracker will make it much easier for all personas, including myself, to identify and prioritize work.

### Dependency on `refactor`
The plan mentions a dependency on `refactor` for "refatoração do módulo de issues para facilitar automação de labels."

- **Clarification Needed:** I'm not currently aware of an "issues module" in the codebase that's slated for refactoring. My primary focus is on addressing existing linting warnings and code smells identified by `ruff` and other pre-commit tools.
- **Proposal:** If there's a specific part of the codebase that needs refactoring to support your automation goals, please create a new issue with the details. That will allow the work to be properly tracked and prioritized against other refactoring tasks.

### Suggestions
- **Automated Labeling:** While I can't commit to a specific refactoring without more details, I fully support the idea of automating the labeling process. When the time comes, I'd be happy to review the code to ensure it's clean, maintainable, and well-tested.

Overall, a solid plan. I look forward to seeing the results of this work.
