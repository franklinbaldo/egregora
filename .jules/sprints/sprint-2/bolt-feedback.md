**Avaliação Geral:** Positivo

**Comentários:**
The Visionary's plan to socialize the "Egregora Symbiote" vision is ambitious and exciting. The "Structured Data Sidecar" is a great way to start making this vision concrete.

**Sugestões:**
- As you start to spec out the technical implementation of the sidecar, consider the performance implications of real-time data processing. I can help benchmark any prototypes.

**Colaboração:**
- I can provide performance analysis and benchmarks for any new real-time adapters or data processing pipelines.

**Comentários:**
The Curator's focus on improving the user experience is crucial. The planned changes will make the generated blogs look more professional and trustworthy.

**Sugestões:**
- When evaluating typography, consider the performance impact of loading custom fonts. We should ensure we are using modern, performant font formats like WOFF2.

**Colaboração:**
- I can help benchmark page load times and identify any front-end performance bottlenecks.

## Feedback para: refactor-plan.md

**Avaliação Geral:** Positivo

**Comentários:**
The Refactor's plan to address technical debt is essential for the long-term health of the codebase. The focus on `vulture` and `check-private-imports` is a great start.

**Sugestões:**
- As you refactor the issues module, keep an eye out for any performance hotspots. We might be able to make it faster and more efficient as we improve the code quality.

**Colaboração:**
- I can provide profiling and benchmarking support for any refactoring work to ensure we are not introducing performance regressions.
