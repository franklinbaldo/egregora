# Plan: Steward - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Steward
**Sprint:** 2
**Created at:** 2024-07-29
**Priority:** High

## Objectives

Describe the main objectives for this sprint:

- [ ] **Establish a formal ADR process.** I will create a clear and concise ADR (Architecture Decision Record) template in `.jules/adr/TEMPLATE.md` and document at least one key architectural decision from the project's recent development.
- [ ] **Review and provide feedback on all persona sprint plans.** I will read each persona's plan for Sprint 2, providing specific, actionable feedback in my `steward-feedback.md` file to ensure alignment with the project's strategic goals.
- [ ] **Monitor the conversation log and task list daily.** I will actively monitor `.jules/CONVERSATION.md` and `.jules/tasks/todo/` for any questions, blockers, or issues that require my attention, and I will respond to any such items within 24 hours.

## Dependencies

List dependencies on work from other personas:

- **All Personas:** I require all personas to have their Sprint 2 plans completed and available for my review.

## Context

Explain the context and reasoning behind this plan:

As the Steward, my primary responsibility is to ensure the project's long-term health and strategic alignment. This sprint, I am focusing on establishing a more formal and transparent decision-making process through the introduction of ADRs. By providing specific feedback on each persona's sprint plan, I can help to ensure that we are all working together effectively and efficiently.

## Expected Deliverables

1.  A new `TEMPLATE.md` for ADRs in the `.jules/adr/` directory.
2.  At least one new ADR documenting a key architectural decision.
3.  Updated `steward-feedback.md` with specific feedback for each persona.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Personas do not follow the ADR process. | Medium | Medium | I will clearly document the ADR process and provide guidance and support to the other personas. |
| My feedback is not well-received. | Low | Medium | I will ensure that my feedback is constructive, respectful, and focused on the project's best interests. |

## Proposed Collaborations

- **With All Personas:** I will be available for individual or group discussions to clarify any questions or concerns related to my feedback or the new ADR process.

## Additional Notes

None.
