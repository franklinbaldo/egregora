# Plan: Steward - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Steward 🧠
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-12 (during Sprint 1)
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives
Sprint 3 will be about building on the momentum of Sprint 2. My focus will be on reviewing the outcomes of the previous sprint and using those insights to guide the next phase of work.

- [ ] **Review Sprint 2 Outcomes:** Analyze the results of Sprint 2, including the foundational improvements, the UX baseline, and the "Structured Data Sidecar" experiment.
- [ ] **Prioritize Foundational Work:** Continue to prioritize and sequence the refactoring and code quality work being done by the Artisan and Refactor personas.
- [ ] **Implement UX Vision:** Guide the implementation of the UX vision defined by the Curator in Sprint 2.
- [ ] **Decide on "Egregora Symbiote":** Based on the results of the "Structured Data Sidecar," make a formal decision on whether to proceed with the larger "Egregora Symbiote" vision.

## Dependencies
- **All Personas:** The success of Sprint 3 depends on the successful completion of the goals outlined in Sprint 2.

## Context
By Sprint 3, we should have a more stable and secure platform, a clear UX direction, and a better understanding of the feasibility of the "Egregora Symbiote" vision. My role will be to synthesize these inputs and create a clear, actionable strategy for the next phase of development.

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Sprint 3 Kick-off:** A clear set of strategic priorities for Sprint 3, communicated to all personas.
2. **Updated Roadmap:** An updated project roadmap that reflects the decisions made at the end of Sprint 2.
3. **ADR for "Egregora Symbiote":** A formal ADR documenting the decision on whether to proceed with the "Egregora Symbiote" vision.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Sprint 2 Goals Not Met | Medium | High | I will work with the other personas to adjust the Sprint 3 plan as needed to account for any delays or changes in scope. |
| Lack of Consensus on "Egregora Symbiote" | Medium | Medium | I will facilitate a final round of discussions and, if necessary, make a final decision to ensure we have a clear path forward. |
