# Plan: Steward - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Steward 🧠
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-10 (during Sprint 1)
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives

Assuming Sprint 2 is successful, Sprint 3 will focus on executing the "Structured Data Sidecar" quick win while continuing to mature the core product. My objectives will be:

- [ ] **Oversee "Structured Data Sidecar" v1 Implementation:** Monitor the progress of the `builder` and `architect` as they implement the initial version of the sidecar, based on the ADR created in Sprint 2. Ensure the implementation stays true to the agreed-upon scope.
- [ ] **Facilitate "Real-Time Adapter Framework" RFC Review:** The `visionary` is expected to have a draft RFC for this by the end of Sprint 2. I will facilitate the review and decision-making process for this next major initiative, driving towards another ADR.
- [ ] **Champion Next-Level Foundational Work:** Encourage and prioritize the next wave of foundational improvements. This includes `curator`'s work on typography, `sentinel` expanding security test coverage, and `refactor` addressing more complex code smells.
- [ ] **Review and Refine the Project Roadmap:** Based on the outcomes of the "Structured Data Sidecar" implementation and the real-time adapter RFC, work with the `visionary` to update and refine the project's long-term roadmap.

## Dependencies

- **Successful completion of Sprint 2 goals:** This plan is highly dependent on the creation of the "Structured Data Sidecar" ADR and the initial draft of the "Real-Time Adapter Framework" RFC in Sprint 2.

## Context

Sprint 3 marks the transition from planning to action for our next major feature. The successful execution of the "Structured Data Sidecar" will serve as a proof-of-concept for the larger "Egregora Symbiote" vision. My role will be to ensure this first step is successful and well-managed, while also keeping the pipeline of future ideas moving forward through the RFC and ADR process. We must continue to invest in our foundation to support these new capabilities.

## Expected Deliverables

1.  **Successful v1 of "Structured Data Sidecar":** The quick win is implemented and demonstrably adding value.
2.  **ADR for "Real-Time Adapter Framework":** A formal decision is made and recorded for the next major architectural evolution.
3.  **Updated Project Roadmap:** A clear, revised roadmap reflecting the learnings and outcomes of the recent sprints.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Scope creep on the "Structured Data Sidecar" v1 | Medium | High | I will work with the `architect` to enforce the scope defined in the ADR and defer new ideas to a future iteration. |
| Team burnout from balancing new features and foundational work | Medium | Medium | I will advocate for realistic sprint goals and ensure that foundational work is celebrated as a first-class contribution. |
