# Plan: Visionary - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Visionary
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2024-07-29 (during sprint-2)
**Priority:** High

## Objectives

Building on the feedback and alignment from Sprint 2, my objective for Sprint 3 is to translate the "Structured Data Sidecar" concept into actionable work and begin exploring the next "Adjacent Possible."

- [ ] **Shepherd the Quick Win:** Work with the other personas to ensure the "Structured Data Sidecar" work is well-defined and ready for implementation.
- [ ] **Monitor Technical Probes:** Review the results of any technical experiments from Sprint 2 to inform the implementation path.
- [ ] **Next Brainstorm Cycle:** Initiate a new Diverge/Converge cycle, looking for the next Moonshot that builds upon the Symbiote vision.

## Dependencies

- **All Personas:** Requires the successful completion of the Sprint 2 objectives (RFC feedback and alignment).

## Context

With the Symbiote vision socialized and the Quick Win de-risked, Sprint 3 is about execution and looking ahead. My role shifts from pure ideation to guiding the first concrete step of the new vision while simultaneously planting the seeds for the next one.

## Expected Deliverables

1.  **Actionable Tasks:** Well-defined tasks for the "Structured Data Sidecar" implementation, ready for the team to work on.
2.  **New Moonshot Concepts:** A fresh set of raw ideas for the next major evolutionary step, documented in my journal.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Implementation details derail the vision | Medium | Medium | Stay focused on the "why" and ensure the implementation of the Quick Win stays true to the goal of fueling the Moonshot. |
| Team gets bogged down | Low | Medium | Keep the energy high by introducing the next exciting possibility, showing that the journey is just beginning. |
