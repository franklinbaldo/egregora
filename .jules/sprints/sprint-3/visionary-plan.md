# Visionary's Plan - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Visionary 🔮
**Sprint:** 3
**Date:** 2024-07-26
**Priority:** Medium

## Goal: Pave the Path for Implementation & Identify the Next Leap

With the "Oracle" vision socialized and refined in Sprint 2, the goal of Sprint 3 is to translate that vision into actionable, tactical work and to begin looking for the *next* adjacent possible. This sprint is about bridging the gap between the grand vision and the first lines of code, and ensuring our innovation pipeline is never empty.

## Key Initiatives

1.  **Deconstruct the "Related Concepts API" into User Stories:**
    *   **Task:** Work with the Architect and Builder personas to break down the Quick-Win RFC (`002-related-concepts-api.md`) into a concrete, prioritized backlog of user stories or technical tasks.
    *   **Action:** Co-create a new document, `.jules/sprints/sprint-3/oracle-api-backlog.md`, that lists the specific, bite-sized tasks required to deliver the API. This will be the direct input for the Builder's Sprint 3 or 4 plan. My role is not to define the *how*, but to ensure the *what* and *why* of the RFC are not lost in translation.

2.  **"Friction Hunt" for the Next Quick Win:**
    *   **Task:** Now that the team is thinking about a queryable knowledge base, I will analyze the current user workflow to find the next point of friction that a more powerful query engine could solve.
    *   **Exploration Areas:**
        *   **Author Profiles:** Can we auto-generate author summaries based on the concepts they discuss most frequently?
        *   **Topic Pages:** Can we move beyond simple tags to create dynamic "Topic Pages" that are auto-generated summaries of a specific concept?
        *   **Search:** Is the current site search good enough, or is its weakness the next problem to solve?
    *   **Deliverable:** A new Quick-Win RFC (`003-*.md`) that builds on the "Related Concepts API" and continues the momentum toward the Oracle.

3.  **Review Project Trajectory:**
    *   **Task:** Analyze the work completed in Sprints 1 and 2 across all personas.
    *   **Goal:** Identify any emerging patterns or assumptions that need to be challenged. Is the project drifting from the vision? Are we getting stuck in a new local maximum? This is a continuous course-correction process.
    *   **Deliverable:** A short "State of the Vision" update in my Sprint 3 journal entry.

## Why This Work Matters

- **Connects Vision to Reality:** This sprint is the critical handoff from high-level strategy to on-the-ground execution.
- **Maintains Momentum:** By identifying the next Quick Win *before* the first one is even finished, we ensure there is always a clear, valuable next step to take. This prevents the project from stalling after a major feature ships.
- **Ensures Strategic Integrity:** The continuous review process ensures that we are not just blindly following a plan, but are constantly adapting and refining our path to the moonshot.
