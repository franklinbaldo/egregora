## 🔧 Refactor's Plan for Sprint 3

### High-Level Goal
Shift focus from basic linting to more complex refactoring opportunities that improve the overall architecture and design of the codebase.

### Planned Tasks
1.  **Introduce Property-Based Testing:** Identify areas of the code that would benefit from property-based testing (e.g., parsing functions, data transformations) and introduce `hypothesis` to create more robust tests.
2.  **Refactor Complex Functions:** Use metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity from `ruff`) to identify and refactor complex functions or classes.
3.  **Improve Type Hint Coverage:** Increase the strictness of `mypy` and fix any new type errors that are revealed.
