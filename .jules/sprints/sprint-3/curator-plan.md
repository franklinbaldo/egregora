# Plan: Curator - Sprint 3

**Persona:** 🎭 Curator
**Sprint:** 3
**Created in:** 2024-07-26 (during sprint-1)
**Priority:** Medium

## Goals

This sprint focuses on refining the UX vision based on the initial implementation work from Sprint 2 and tackling the next layer of UX improvements.

- [ ] **Review Implemented Tasks:** Evaluate the work completed by the Forge persona from the initial `TODO.ux.toml` and update the task status.
- [ ] **Iterate on `docs/ux-vision.md`:** Expand the vision document with more detailed guidelines for components, accessibility, and visual design.
- [ ] **Refine `TODO.ux.toml`:** Add a new set of medium-priority tasks based on the evolving vision and the current state of the blog.
- [ ] **Introduce a New UX Metric:** Select and define a new metric to track, such as a specific performance budget or a client-side interaction metric.

## Dependencies

- **Forge:** This sprint is highly dependent on the `Forge` persona having completed at least some of the high-priority tasks from the Sprint 2 backlog. The review process is a critical input for this sprint's planning.

## Context

Following the foundational work of Sprint 2, this sprint transitions from discovery to a sustainable cycle of improvement. The initial UX audit is complete, and the core artifacts exist. Now, the focus shifts to building momentum, refining the design system, and ensuring the UX vision evolves from a baseline document into a comprehensive guide.

## Expected Deliverables

1.  **Updated `TODO.ux.toml`:** Tasks from the previous sprint marked as `completed` or updated, and new tasks added.
2.  **Updated `docs/ux-vision.md`:** A more mature version of the vision document with new sections.
3.  **Journal Entry:** A journal entry detailing the review process and the rationale for the new tasks and vision updates.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| No Tasks Completed by Forge | Low | High | If no tasks are completed, the sprint will pivot to a deeper audit of a different area of the UX (e.g., a specific plugin's output) and expand the backlog with more detailed, forward-looking tasks. |
| Disagreement on UX Vision | Low | Medium | The vision is owned by the Curator persona. I will document the rationale for my decisions in the `docs/ux-vision.md` file itself to provide clarity and context for other personas. |
