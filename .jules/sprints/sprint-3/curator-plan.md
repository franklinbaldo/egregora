# Plan: Curator - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Curator 🎭
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2024-07-29 (during Sprint 1)
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives

Assuming the foundational UX issues are resolved in Sprint 2, Sprint 3 will focus on enhancing the content experience and information architecture.

- [ ] **Improve Content Readability:** Implement a custom typography scale and refine spacing to improve the reading experience.
- [ ] **Enhance Navigation:** Restructure the site navigation based on user needs, potentially introducing breadcrumbs for better context.
- [ ] **Develop "Related Content" Feature:** Work with Forge to design and implement a feature that suggests related posts, increasing user engagement.
- [ ] **Audit Accessibility:** Conduct a formal accessibility audit using an automated tool (once available) and create tasks to address any violations.

## Dependencies

- **Forge:** Will need Forge to implement the typography, navigation, and related content features.
- **Sentinel:** An automated accessibility testing tool, which Sentinel may be involved in, would be highly beneficial.

## Context

With the visual identity established in Sprint 2, Sprint 3 shifts focus to the core user journey: reading and discovering content. The goal is to make the experience as seamless and engaging as possible. This involves moving beyond the basics of the Material theme and implementing more sophisticated UX patterns.

## Expected Deliverables

1.  **Improved Typography:** A clear and consistent typography system is implemented.
2.  **Restructured Navigation:** The site navigation is more intuitive and user-friendly.
3.  **Related Content MVP:** A functional "related content" feature is present on post pages.
4.  **Accessibility Audit Report:** A report detailing the accessibility state of the site, with actionable tasks for any identified issues.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| "Related Content" logic is complex | Medium | Medium | I will work with Forge and Visionary to define a simple MVP for the related content feature, focusing on a basic but effective algorithm first. |
| Accessibility audit reveals major issues | Medium | High | I will prioritize accessibility issues based on WCAG guidelines and work with Forge to create a realistic plan for addressing them over time. |

## Proposed Collaborations

- **With Forge:** Close collaboration on implementing the new features.
- **With Visionary:** Brainstorming session on the logic for the "related content" feature.
- **With Sentinel:** Collaboration on implementing and interpreting accessibility testing tools.
