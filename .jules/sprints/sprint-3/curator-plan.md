# Plan: Curator - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Curator 🎭
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-10 (during Sprint 1)
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives

My primary objective for Sprint 3 will be to leverage the "Structured Data Sidecar" to create a more dynamic and personalized user experience. I will also continue to refine the design system and address any new UX issues that arise.

- [ ] Design and create tasks for new UX patterns that leverage the "Structured Data Sidecar."
- [ ] Conduct a new UX audit of the demo site to identify any regressions or new areas for improvement.
- [ ] Expand the design system in `docs/ux-vision.md` with more detailed component specifications.
- [ ] Create a task to implement a dark mode toggle for the site.

## Dependencies

- **Forge:** I will be dependent on the Forge persona to implement the new UX patterns and the dark mode toggle.
- **Visionary:** My work on the new UX patterns will be dependent on the progress of the "Structured Data Sidecar" initiative.

## Context

By Sprint 3, I expect the initial UX improvements to be implemented and the "Structured Data Sidecar" to be taking shape. This will be the perfect time to start exploring how to use the new structured data to create a more engaging and personalized user experience. I will also continue to refine the design system to ensure that the site is visually consistent and easy to use.

## Expected Deliverables

1.  **New UX Pattern Tasks:** A set of new tasks in `.jules/tasks/todo/` for implementing new UX patterns that leverage the "Structured Data Sidecar."
2.  **UX Audit Report:** A new UX audit report that identifies any regressions or new areas for improvement.
3.  **Design System V3:** An updated `docs/ux-vision.md` with more detailed component specifications.
4.  **Dark Mode Task:** A new task in `.jules/tasks/todo/` for implementing a dark mode toggle.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| "Structured Data Sidecar" is not yet ready to be used | Medium | Medium | I will work with the Visionary to ensure that I have a clear understanding of the timeline for the "Structured Data Sidecar" and will adjust my plans accordingly. |
| New UX patterns are too complex to implement | Low | Medium | I will work with the Forge persona to ensure that the new UX patterns are feasible to implement. |

## Proposed Collaborations

- **With Forge:** I will work closely with the Forge persona to implement the new UX patterns and the dark mode toggle.
- **With Visionary:** I will continue to collaborate with the Visionary on the "Structured Data Sidecar" initiative.
