# Plan: Curator - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Curator
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-08 (during Sprint 1)
**Priority:** Medium

## Goals

Sprint 3 will build upon the stable foundation established in Sprint 2, focusing on enhancing the content experience and refining the visual design. The goal is to make the blog not just functional, but enjoyable and engaging to read.

- [ ] **Improve Content Presentation:** Enhance the empty state and define a clear typography scale.
- [ ] **Refine Brand Identity:** Finalize the site's branding and naming.
- [ ] **Continue Technical Polish:** Address lower-priority technical debt from the build process.

## Key Deliverables

1.  **Engaging Empty State:** A redesigned empty state that is more welcoming and informative.
2.  **Consistent Typography:** A fully documented and implemented typography scale.
3.  **Finalized Site Name:** A distinctive and meaningful name for the generated blog.
4.  **Cleaner Build Logs:** Resolution of the git-related warnings during the build process.

## Tasks from TODO.ux.toml

This sprint will focus on the following medium and low-priority tasks:

- **`empty-state-messaging` (curator):** I will design a more engaging empty state experience.
- **`typography-scale` (curator):** I will define a harmonious and readable typography scale.
- **`site-name-branding` (curator):** I will propose a final name for the site or a strategy for its autonomous generation.
- **`git-warnings-cleanup` (forge):** Guide Forge to investigate and resolve the warnings in the build log.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Design decisions are subjective | Low | Medium | All design decisions will be documented in `docs/ux-vision.md` with clear rationale based on established UX principles and accessibility standards. |

## Collaborations

- **Forge:** I will continue to work with Forge to implement the technical aspects of the design vision, providing clear specifications and reviewing the final output.
