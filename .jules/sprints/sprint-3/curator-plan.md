# Plan: Curator - Sprint 3
**Persona:** Curator 🎭
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2024-07-29 (during Sprint 1)
**Priority:** Medium

## Goals
Sprint 3 will build on the established design system, focusing on refining the reading experience and introducing more sophisticated, data-driven UI components. The goal is to make the blog not just usable, but delightful and insightful.

- [ ] **Refine Visual Polish:** Audit the site for consistent spacing, rhythm, and alignment using an 8px grid system. Create tasks to address inconsistencies.
- [ ] **Design Author Profiles:** Design a dedicated author profile page and a smaller author card component to be used on posts. This is a key step towards surfacing the "collective" aspect of the blog.
- [ ] **Data-Driven UX Prototyping:** Collaborate with Visionary and Forge to prototype a "Topic Cloud" or similar visualization on the homepage, generated from the blog's content.
- [ ] **Advanced Accessibility (A11y):** Conduct manual keyboard navigation and screen reader audits to identify issues that automated tools miss.
- [ ] **Improve Social Sharing Cards:** The current social sharing cards are basic. Design a more visually appealing and informative template for social media previews.

## Dependencies
- **Forge:** All design work will result in implementation tasks for Forge.
- **Visionary:** Collaboration on data-driven UX features will require Visionary's input on what data is available and meaningful.

## Context
With the foundational UX in place from Sprint 2, Sprint 3 is about adding layers of polish and intelligence. The focus shifts from "making it work" to "making it shine." The design of author profiles is the first major feature that directly addresses the "group reflection" aspect of Egregora.

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Visual Polish Tasks:** A set of specific tasks for Forge to improve spacing and alignment across the site.
2. **Author Profile & Card Designs:** High-fidelity mockups or detailed descriptions for the author page and component, documented in `docs/ux-vision.md`.
3. **Data-Driven UX Spec:** A clear specification for the "Topic Cloud" feature, created in collaboration with Visionary.
4. **Manual A11y Report:** A journal entry documenting the findings from the manual accessibility audit.
5. **Social Card Template:** A new design for social sharing cards.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Data for UX features is not readily available | Medium | Medium | I will work closely with Visionary from the start to ensure that my design proposals are grounded in technical reality. We will start with a simple proof-of-concept. |
| Design implementation is more complex than anticipated | Low | Medium | I will break down designs into small, manageable components and provide detailed implementation guidance to Forge. |

## Proposed Collaborations
- **With Forge:** Continuous collaboration on implementing the design specs.
- **With Visionary:** A dedicated workshop to brainstorm and spec out the first data-driven UX feature.
