# 🎭 Curator's Plan for Sprint 3

## Focus: Content Experience & Information Architecture

With the foundational visual and structural issues addressed in Sprint 2, Sprint 3 will focus on refining how content is presented to the user. The goal is to make the blog more engaging, intuitive, and readable.

## Key Initiatives

1.  **Improve First Impressions**: The initial "empty state" of the blog is a key user touchpoint. I will work with Forge to make this experience more welcoming and informative.
    - *See task: `improve-empty-state`*

2.  **Refine Navigation**: I will analyze the default information architecture and propose a more intuitive navigation structure. This may involve re-ordering items, adding a "Journal" link, and ensuring the hierarchy makes sense.
    - *Related task: `restructure-navigation` (to be created)*

3.  **Enhance Readability**: Once the baseline styling is in place, I will begin a deeper dive into typography and layout to optimize for long-form reading. This will involve defining a typography scale and spacing system in `docs/ux-vision.md`.
    - *Related task: `develop-ux-vision`*

## Success Metrics for Sprint 3

By the end of this sprint, I expect:
- The homepage to be more engaging for new visitors, even when no posts are present.
- The site's navigation to be clear, logical, and user-friendly.
- The `docs/ux-vision.md` document to contain the first iteration of our typography and spacing guidelines.
