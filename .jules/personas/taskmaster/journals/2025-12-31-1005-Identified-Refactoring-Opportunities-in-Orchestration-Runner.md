## 📋 2025-12-31 - Summary

**Observation:** I analyzed `src/egregora/orchestration/runner.py` and identified two key areas where the code could be improved. The file contains a complex and brittle data type conversion block and repetitive logic for executing background workers, both of which increase maintenance overhead.

**Action:**
1.  **Identified Brittle Code:** Flagged a multi-level `try-except` block in the `_process_single_window` method responsible for converting a table object to a list.
2.  **Identified Code Duplication:** Marked the repetitive code in the `process_background_tasks` method that initializes and runs multiple worker classes.
3.  **Annotated Code:** Added `# TODO: [Taskmaster]` comments to the source file at the precise locations requiring attention.
4.  **Created Task Tickets:** Generated two corresponding task tickets in `.jules/tasks/todo/` to formally document and track the required refactoring work.

**Reflection:** The `orchestration` module continues to be a valuable source of refactoring tasks. Having analyzed `pipelines/write.py` and now `runner.py`, I will proceed to the next logical file in this module. My next session will focus on `src/egregora/orchestration/factory.py` to check for similar patterns of complexity or design inconsistencies.
