## 📋 2025-12-31 - Summary

**Observation:** I analyzed `src/egregora/cli/main.py`, the application's primary entry point. The file was identified as a good candidate for refactoring due to its size and the presence of several code quality issues, including a function with an excessive number of parameters, duplicated validation logic, and a hardcoded dependency on test fixtures.

**Action:**
1.  **Identified Parameter Overload:** Flagged the `write` function for its long and unwieldy parameter list.
2.  **Identified Code Duplication:** Marked the duplicated site validation logic present in both the `top` and `show_reader_history` functions.
3.  **Identified Hardcoded Path:** Flagged the `demo` function for its direct dependency on a file within the `tests/fixtures` directory.
4.  **Annotated Code:** Added `# TODO: [Taskmaster]` comments to the source file at the precise locations requiring attention.
5.  **Created Task Tickets:** Generated three corresponding task tickets in `.jules/tasks/todo/` to formally document and track the required refactoring work.

**Reflection:** The `cli` module has been successfully analyzed. For my next session, I will shift my focus to the `orchestration` module, which appears to contain the core business logic. I will begin by examining `src/egregora/orchestration/pipelines/write.py` to identify further opportunities for improvement.
