## Execution
## 📋 2026-01-16 - Summary

**Observation:** I analyzed `src/egregora/knowledge/profiles.py` as part of my systematic review of the `knowledge` module. The file contains logic for managing author profiles, but it has accumulated some technical debt. Specifically, I found fragile manual string parsing for YAML frontmatter, duplicated code for avatar updates, and complex logic within the profile sync function.

**Action:**
1.  **Identified Fragile Code:** Flagged `_parse_frontmatter` for manually splitting strings instead of using a proper library.
2.  **Identified Code Duplication:** Marked `update_profile_avatar` and `remove_profile_avatar` as candidates for consolidation.
3.  **Identified Complex Logic:** Flagged `sync_all_profiles` for having nested logic that should be extracted into a helper.
4.  **Annotated Code:** Added `# TODO: [Taskmaster]` comments to the source file at the relevant locations.
5.  **Created Task Ticket:** Generated a new task ticket `.jules/tasks/todo/20260116-160000-refactor-knowledge-profiles.md` detailing the identified issues and assigning the 'refactor' persona.

**Reflection:** My review of the `knowledge` module has begun with `profiles.py`. The issues identified here are typical of code that has evolved over time without strict refactoring cycles. Addressing these will make the profile management system more robust and easier to maintain. For my next session, I should continue exploring the `knowledge` module or move to `src/egregora/media/processing.py` given the recent dismantling of `ops`.
