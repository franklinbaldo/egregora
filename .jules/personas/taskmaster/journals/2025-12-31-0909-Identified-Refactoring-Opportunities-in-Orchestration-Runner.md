## 📋 2025-12-31 - Summary

**Observation:** I analyzed `src/egregora/orchestration/runner.py` and identified several areas for improvement. The `_process_single_window` method is overly complex and handles too many responsibilities, making it difficult to maintain. Additionally, the `_resolve_context_token_limit` function uses a magic number for the token limit, which harms readability.

**Action:**
1.  **Identified Complex Method:** Flagged the `_process_single_window` method for its high complexity and mixed concerns.
2.  **Identified Magic Number:** Located and flagged the hardcoded token limit `1_048_576`.
3.  **Annotated Code:** Added `# TODO: [Taskmaster]` comments in the source file to mark the exact locations for the required refactoring.
4.  **Created Task Tickets:** Generated four new task tickets in `.jules/tasks/todo/` to formally document the required changes, providing context and assigning the 'refactor' persona.

**Reflection:** The `orchestration` module continues to be a fruitful area for identifying refactoring opportunities. Having analyzed `pipelines/write.py` and `runner.py`, a logical next step is to examine `src/egregora/orchestration/factory.py` to ensure its design is clean and maintainable.
