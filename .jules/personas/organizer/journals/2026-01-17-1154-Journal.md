## Execution
## 🗂️ 2026-01-05 - Refactored Ops Package

**Observation:** The `src/egregora/ops` package was an ambiguous "grab-bag" containing two unrelated modules: `media.py` (media asset processing) and `taxonomy.py` (semantic knowledge organization). This structure obscured the intent of the code and made discovery difficult.

**Action:**
- Analyzed the contents of `ops` and identified their true domains.
- Moved `src/egregora/ops/taxonomy.py` to `src/egregora/knowledge/taxonomy.py`, aligning it with other knowledge-related modules.
- Created a new domain package `src/egregora/media` and moved `src/egregora/ops/media.py` to `src/egregora/media/processing.py`.
- Relocated corresponding tests to `tests/unit/knowledge` and `tests/unit/media`.
- Updated all import references across the codebase.
- Removed the now-empty `src/egregora/ops` package.
- Verified all changes with the test suite.

**Reflection:** This refactoring eliminated a vague architectural component (`ops`) and replaced it with clear, domain-driven structures (`knowledge` and `media`). The codebase now better reflects the business domains of "Knowledge Management" and "Media Processing". Future work should continue to monitor generic containers like `common` to prevent similar accumulations of unrelated logic.
