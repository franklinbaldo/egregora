## 🧠 2026-01-16 - Implementing 'The Portal' Vision

**Observation:** The project was in a state where the 'Portal' UX vision (as defined in `docs/ux-vision.md`) was not being realized due to configuration issues (hardcoded accent colors) and missing dependencies. This resulted in a poor Developer Experience (DX) where the `demo` command would fail or produce a site that didn't match the intended branding. The `social` plugin was also causing build failures or not working as intended.

**Action:** I took on the strategic task of aligning the implementation with the vision.
1.  Modified `pyproject.toml` to include critical missing dependencies (`google-generativeai`, `mkdocs-material[imaging]`, etc.) to ensure a smooth DX.
2.  Updated `mkdocs.yml.jinja` to switch the accent color to `custom`, enabling the `extra.css` to control the branding as per the 'Portal' design system.
3.  Enabled the `social` plugin and ensured the `cards` feature is active.
4.  Created a placeholder `favicon.png` and ensured it is scaffolded correctly, fixing a visual gap.
5.  Verified the changes by generating a demo site and building it, confirming that the configuration is correct and the build succeeds (even if content generation was rate-limited).

**Reflection:** By fixing these foundational issues, I've unblocked future work on the frontend and ensured that the project's 'Portal' vision is technically supported. The `social` plugin integration is now correct, although local testing of the generated images has limitations (RSS plugin 404s on localhost), the build process is robust. This moves us closer to a professional, immersive user experience.
