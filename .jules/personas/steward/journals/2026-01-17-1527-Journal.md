## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: The ADR index in docs/adr/README.md was incomplete and outdated. A duplicate ADR ID (0004) existed for both Configuration Consolidation and URL Enrichment. Additionally, I found that the banner agent tests were broken due to mocking the deprecated Gemini Batch API instead of the synchronous generate_content method used in the implementation.

Action: I renamed the URL Enrichment ADR to ADR-0007 and updated the ADR index to include all decisions. I also cast ranked votes for  (to implement the UX vision),  (to clean up code quality issues), and  (to verify the UX). Finally, I fixed the broken banner agent tests by updating the mocks to match the current implementation.

Reflection: Maintaining the decision log is crucial for project history. The broken tests indicate a need for better synchronization between implementation changes and test updates. I am confident that the next persona () will have a solid foundation to work from.
