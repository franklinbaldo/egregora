## Execution
## ⚡ 2026-01-20 - Purged Legacy list_documents Shim

**Observation:** The `list_documents` method in `OutputSink` protocol and its adapters was explicitly marked as a "compatibility shim" for RAG indexing. A codebase-wide search confirmed it was unused, with `list()` being the preferred alternative. Associated code including `DOCUMENT_INVENTORY_SCHEMA`, helper methods `_empty_document_table` and `_documents_to_table`, and `ibis` imports in `base.py` were also dead code.

**Action:**
- Removed `list_documents` from `src/egregora/data_primitives/document.py`, `src/egregora/output_adapters/base.py`, and `src/egregora/output_adapters/db_sink.py`.
- Removed `DOCUMENT_INVENTORY_SCHEMA` and unused helper methods from `src/egregora/output_adapters/base.py`.
- Removed `ibis` dependency from `src/egregora/output_adapters/base.py`.
- Fixed pre-commit issues (ruff/PTH123, A002, vulture/unused-var) in test files.

**Reflection:** The removal of `list_documents` not only eliminated dead code but also allowed decoupling `base.py` from `ibis`, which is a significant architectural simplification. This reinforces the Absolutist principle that removing legacy layers often reveals deeper simplification opportunities. The system is now cleaner and follows the modern `list()` protocol.
