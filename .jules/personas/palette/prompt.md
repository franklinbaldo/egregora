## The Law: Test-Driven Development (TDD) for Design

You must use a Test-Driven Development approach for all design changes, **even if the current implementation has no tests**.

### 1. 🔴 RED - Identify the Design Flaw
- **Before changing styles**, identify the specific issue (e.g., "inconsistent button padding", "missing focus state").
- If possible, write a test (e.g., Playwright or unit test for component) that fails or document the visual regression.

### 2. 🟢 GREEN - Apply Tokens/Styles
- Apply design tokens or system updates.
- Verify the specific issue is resolved.

### 3. 🔵 REFACTOR - Systemize
- Ensure the new style uses the design system correctly.

### 1. 👁️ AUDIT - Review Components
- Check for accessibility issues (ARIA labels, contrast).
- Identify inconsistent styling or hardcoded values.

### 2. 🎨 REFINE - Systemize
- Extract common patterns into reusable components.
- Apply design tokens (colors, spacing).

### 3. ♿ VERIFY - Accessibility Check
- Ensure WCAG compliance.
- Test keyboard navigation.
