## 🕸️ 2026-01-12 - Summary

**Observation:** I was tasked with reviewing open pull requests, but no `PR_REVIEWS.md` log existed. One open PR, #2393, was found.

**Action:**
- I created the `PR_REVIEWS.md` file.
- I performed an initial analysis of PR #2393. Due to an inability to determine the CI status from the GitHub API, I logged it as `INFORMATIONAL_ONLY`.

**Reflection:** The immediate next step is to commit the new `PR_REVIEWS.md` file to establish the audit log. My process for handling PRs with indeterminate CI statuses is now established: log and wait. I will re-evaluate on my next run.
