## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
**Observation:** Documentation for Architecture and Roadmap was missing from navigation. Pre-commit hooks found linting errors in tests. **Action:** Updated mkdocs.yml and ADR/README.md. Fixed linting errors in test_hire_steps.py and test_voting_steps.py. **Reflection:** Documentation is now more discoverable. Codebase is cleaner.
