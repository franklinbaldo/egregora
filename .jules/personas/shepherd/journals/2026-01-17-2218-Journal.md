## Execution
🧑‍🌾 2026-01-20 - Coverage Harvest: +2% Gain (Parsing & Security)

**Observation:**
Identified critical gaps in  (60% coverage) and  (28% coverage). These modules handle untrusted input and require rigorous behavioral verification.

**Action:**
- **Cultivated **: Added comprehensive tests for zip bombs, path traversal, and size limits, achieving 100% coverage for .
- **Cultivated **: Implemented robust parsing tests for WhatsApp exports, covering PII scrubbing, date parsing variations, and malformed lines, achieving 94% coverage.
- **Enhanced RAG Tests**: Added behavioral tests for  and , ensuring robust text splitting and document handling.
- **Raised Standards**: Updated  threshold to 56% in  and .

**Reflection:**
Behavioral testing proved highly effective for the complex parsing logic in , revealing edge cases that simple unit tests might miss. Mocking  allowed for safe and fast execution of security tests without touching the filesystem. The harvest is good, with a solid gain in confidence for input handling layers.
