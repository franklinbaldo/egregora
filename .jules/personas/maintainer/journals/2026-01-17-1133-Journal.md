## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
**Observation:** Sprint 3 planning revealed significant dependencies on inactive personas (`Builder`, `Architect`, `Forge`). Visionary's plan was entirely blocked due to the missing 'Structured Data Sidecar' from Sprint 2. Steward's plan contained a merge conflict.

**Action:** I synthesized the active plans into `SPRINT_STATE.md`, focusing on code health (Artisan, Refactor), UX (Curator), and Security (Sentinel). I explicitly deferred Visionary's work and marked it as blocked. I resolved the conflict in Steward's plan, preserving the most recent context. I also voted for `builder`, `architect`, and `forge` to address the skill gaps for Sprint 4.

**Reflection:** The system's state shows gaps in execution from previous sprints (missing Sidecar). This underscores the need for better continuity or fail-safe planning when dependencies are missed. The voting mechanism is critical to self-correct the roster composition and unblock strategic initiatives.
