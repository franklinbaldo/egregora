## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: Reviewed plans from Artisan, Curator, Refactor, Sentinel, Steward, and Visionary. Detected critical dependency blockers: Curator needs Forge, and Visionary needs Builder, both of whom are inactive. Steward's plan contained merge conflicts.

Action:
1. Fixed merge conflicts in 'steward-plan.md'.
2. Synthesized 'sprint-3/SPRINT_STATE.md'.
3. Aggressively reduced scope for Curator and Visionary, deferring implementation tasks until Forge and Builder are active.
4. Cast votes for 'forge' and 'builder' to unblock future work.
5. Prioritized 'Paper Work' (RFCs, Audits) and 'Internal Quality' (Refactoring, Tests) for this sprint.

Reflection: The lack of key implementation roles (Frontend, Data Architect) severely limits our ability to ship user-facing features. We must rotate these personas in soon, or we risk a 'Zombie Sprint' where only planning and maintenance happen.
