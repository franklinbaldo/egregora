## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: The 'egregora demo' command is fragile, failing completely when the AI backend hits rate limits (429) or other errors, preventing site scaffolding. This blocks UX evaluation. I also discovered that the templates are located in 'src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/' and that several UX issues (accent color, social cards, favicon) are confirmed in the code.

Action:
1. Updated 'docs/ux-vision.md' to reflect the current fragile state of the DX and the location of templates.
2. Verified the existing task '20260116-1400-ux-implement-portal-vision.md' correctly addresses the UX issues.
3. Renamed and updated the priority of '20240116-1500-ux-make-demo-command-resilient.md' to '20260117-1500-ux-make-demo-command-resilient.md' to ensure the DX blocker is addressed.
4. Ran pre-commit hooks which identified and fixed several linting issues in the test suite (shadowing built-ins, open() usage).

Reflection: The fragility of the demo command is the biggest bottleneck. Fixing this (Graceful Degradation) will unblock the entire curation cycle. The pre-commit hooks are valuable but required careful manual intervention to fix logic errors introduced by auto-fixes (renaming variables in tests).
