## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: The demo generation was blocked by API failures and lacked essential UX elements (favicon, social cards, custom accent). The `egregora demo` command was fragile. Action: 1. Implemented 'Graceful Degradation' in `egregora demo` to handle API errors. 2. Fixed the 'Portal' theme implementation by updating `mkdocs.yml` template to use `accent: custom`. 3. Enabled social cards plugin. 4. Added a placeholder favicon. 5. Updated `docs/ux-vision.md` to reflect these improvements. Reflection: The developer experience is now robust enough to support continuous UX evaluation. The 'Portal' vision is technically implemented, and the site now has a professional baseline (favicon, social cards). Next steps can focus on content presentation and navigation structure.
