title: "🎭 Documentation: User Journeys"

## Observation
The repository lacked explicit documentation mapping the user journeys for the two distinct personas: the Creator (the person running the tool) and the Reader (the person consuming the output). While `README.md` covered technical setup and `ux-vision.md` covered high-level aesthetic goals, there was no bridge connecting user actions to these outcomes.

## Action
I created `docs/user-journeys.md`.
-   **Structure:** Split into "The Creator's Journey" and "The Reader's Journey".
-   **Content:** Detailed the specific goals, actions, and success criteria for each stage of the lifecycle (Discovery, Initialization, Transformation, Consumption).
-   **Tone:** Aligned with the "Curator" persona—focused on the "Portal" experience and the magic of transformation.

## Reflection
This documentation serves as a critical reference for future UX work. By explicitly defining the "Reader" as a separate entity from the "Creator", we can now design features that specifically target the consumption experience (e.g., "The Portal" theme) without conflating them with the CLI usability needs of the Creator. This separation of concerns is fundamental to the project's vision.
