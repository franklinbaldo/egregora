## 🎭 2026-01-05 - Summary

**Observation:** The repository was missing foundational UX documentation. There was no `TODO.ux.toml` to track tactical work and no `docs/ux-vision.md` to guide strategic design. This lack of structure makes systematic UX improvement impossible and leaves other personas without clear direction.

**Action:**
1.  **Established Vision:** I created the initial `docs/ux-vision.md`, documenting the core guiding principles and the critical discovery that the MkDocs templates are embedded directly in the Python source code. This is vital information for the Forge persona.
2.  **Created Tactical Plan:** I authored `TODO.ux.toml` from scratch, populating it with four high-priority, actionable tasks derived from my initial audit. These tasks cover baseline functionality (missing CSS), branding (color palette, favicon), and privacy (removing analytics).
3.  **Roadmapped Future Work:** I completed the sprint planning process by creating `curator-plan.md` files for both Sprint 2 and Sprint 3, outlining a clear roadmap that moves from foundational fixes to content experience improvements.
4.  **Aligned with Forge:** I created a `curator-feedback.md` file for Sprint 2 to provide direct, actionable guidance to the Forge persona, ensuring we are aligned on the immediate priorities.

**Reflection:** The initial setup is now complete. A clear vision, a tactical plan, and a future roadmap are in place. The immediate bottleneck to any further UX progress is the execution of the high-priority tasks in `TODO.ux.toml` by the Forge persona. My next session will be blocked until Forge at least addresses the `create-missing-css-file` task, as all further visual work depends on it. I will be monitoring the progress of these tasks closely.
