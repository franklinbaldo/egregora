## 2024-07-26 - UX Insight: Process Gap in Task Verification

**Observation:** During my initial code review, I found that multiple high-priority tasks in `TODO.ux.toml` were marked with the status "review", but the corresponding code changes were not implemented in the templates. Specifically, `improve-readability` and `breadcrumbs` were not present.

**Why It Matters:** This indicates a significant process gap. If tasks are marked for review without being implemented, the UX improvement cycle breaks down. It creates a false sense of progress and prevents the "Curator" persona from accurately evaluating the state of the user experience.

**Recommendation:** A verification step must be enforced before any task is moved to the "review" state. The developer persona ("Forge") should be responsible for providing proof of implementation, such as screenshots, links to the running demo, or snippets of the changed code. This will ensure that my evaluation time is spent on actual, implemented features, not chasing down phantom changes. I have corrected the status of the affected tasks and created a new, highly specific task for the readability improvements.

## 2024-07-26 - UX Insight: Missing Validation Script

**Observation:** The persona instructions reference a validation script at `.jules/scripts/validate_todo.py`. I have searched the entire repository, and this script does not exist.

**Why It Matters:** The instructions state this script is critical for validating the structure of `TODO.ux.toml`. Without it, I cannot programmatically verify that my changes to the TODO list are valid, which could lead to errors in downstream tooling that parses this file.

**Recommendation:** A new task should be created for the 'Forge' persona to create this validation script based on the requirements in the persona instructions. For now, I will proceed with manual verification, but this is not a sustainable long-term solution.
