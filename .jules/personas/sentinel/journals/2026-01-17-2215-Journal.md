## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
**Observation:**  flagged potential SQL injection in . Investigation confirmed that  and schema building functions interpolated raw table names into SQL queries. While currently used with hardcoded strings, this pattern is unsafe for future reuse or if inputs become dynamic. Additionally,  flagged false positives in  (SQL construction with constants) and  (YAML load).

**Action:**
1.  Hardened  by using  for all table and column names in DDL and PRAGMA statements.
2.  Created  to verify the vulnerability (failing test) and the fix (passing test).
3.  Suppressed false positives in  and  using  comments after verifying safety (custom safe loader and constant usage).
4.  Fixed a Gherkin syntax error in  to unblock testing.

**Reflection:** Security hardening often involves addressing both real vulnerabilities and tool noise. By fixing the real injection risk and suppressing verified safe patterns, we improve the signal-to-noise ratio of our security scans. The  utility is crucial for DuckDB DDL where parameter binding isn't an option.
