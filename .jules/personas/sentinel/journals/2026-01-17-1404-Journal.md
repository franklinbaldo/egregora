## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: Identified several medium-severity SQL injection warnings in Bandit (B608) related to dynamic SQL construction in annotation storage and database management. Also noted a YAML load warning (B506).
Action: Refactored  to use  for table names, ensuring robust protection against future changes. Added  suppression comments with justifications to  (where  was already in use) and  (where a safe custom loader is used). Verified changes with  and a new regression test .
Reflection: Static analysis tools are valuable but require careful triage. False positives are common when using custom defensive patterns. Explicitly marking safe code with  and justification is better than ignoring the warnings, as it documents the security decision for future maintainers. The codebase is now cleaner and explicitly defended.
