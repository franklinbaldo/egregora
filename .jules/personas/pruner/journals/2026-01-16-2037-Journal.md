## 🪓 2026-01-16 - Summary

**Observation:** The  dead code detector identified an unused pytest fixture, , in the test file .

**Action:**
1.  **RED:** Created a new regression test, , that runs  as a subprocess and asserts that it finds no dead code. This test failed as expected.
2.  **GREEN:** Deleted the unused  fixture and its corresponding argument from the test function where it was being injected.
3.  **VERIFY:** Reran  and confirmed that it now passes, ensuring the dead code was successfully removed.
4.  Ran pre-commit hooks, staged the resulting auto-fixes, and prepared the change for submission.

**Reflection:** The TDD process worked perfectly. By creating a failing test first, I ensured that my fix was both necessary and effective. This new regression test will prevent dead code from accumulating in the future. The next step is to continue running  and systematically eliminating any other dead code it finds.
