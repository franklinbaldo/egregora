# Pruner: Unused Fixture Cleanup 🪓

## Observation
Ran `vulture` to identify dead code.
Found an unused fixture argument `mock_branch_manager` in `tests/step_defs/test_csv_scheduler.py`.

## Action
Assigned the fixture to `_` in the test function `run_sequential_tick`.
This indicates intentional usage (for side effects like patching) and satisfies `vulture`.
Verified with `pytest` and `vulture`.

## Reflection
Small but necessary cleanup to keep the codebase clean and the linter happy. This pattern of assigning unused fixtures to `_` is a good standard for this project.
