## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: Refactored BaseWorker to remove strict WorkerContext protocol, simplifying inheritance. Fixed strict typing issues in enricher.py including missing attributes, casting, and method signatures. Action: Applied multiple patches to enricher.py and worker_base.py. Updated prompt with refactoring guidelines. Reflection: The protocol approach was too strict for runtime dynamic attributes; simpler Generic[ContextT] works better while maintaining type hints.
