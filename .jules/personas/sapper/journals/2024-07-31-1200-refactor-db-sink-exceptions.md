## 💣 2024-07-31 - Summary

**Observation:** The `read_document` method in `src/egregora/output_adapters/db_sink.py` was a classic "Look Before You Leap" (LBYL) violation. It returned `Document | None`, forcing callers to perform defensive `if` checks and obscuring the root cause of a missing document.

**Action:** I executed a methodical, TDD-driven refactoring to make this failure mode explicit.
1.  **TDD Protocol:** I first modified the existing unit test to expect a `DocumentNotFoundError`, establishing a failing (RED) test.
2.  **Refactored Implementation:** I changed `DbOutputSink.read_document` to raise `DocumentNotFoundError` when the underlying repository returns `None`. I also updated the method's type hint to `-> Document`.
3.  **Collateral Damage Control:** My initial attempt caused cascading test failures. After a tactical `git reset`, I adopted an incremental verification strategy. I used `grep` to identify all call sites (`materializer.py`, `writer_helpers.py`, `writer_tools.py`, `formatting.py`) and refactored each one to handle the new exception, running relevant unit tests after each change to ensure stability.
4.  **Corrected Flawed Tests:** I identified and fixed a broken mock in the orchestration test suite (`test_runner.py`) that was masking the true source of failures. I also corrected the unit test for `writer_tools.py` to align with the new exception-based contract.

**Reflection:** This mission was a powerful lesson in the importance of incremental verification. A single, seemingly simple change had a wide blast radius that was not initially apparent. The `git reset` was a necessary tactical decision that allowed for a more disciplined and successful second attempt. The key takeaway is that for core component refactoring, verifying each integration point individually is critical to avoiding cascading failures and ensuring a safe and successful defusal. The codebase is now more robust and aligned with the EAFP principle.
