## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
**Observation:** The `_parse_media_result` method in `src/egregora/agents/enricher.py` was returning `None` on failure, forcing callers to check for `None`. This violated the "Trigger, Don't Confirm" principle.

**Action:** I refactored the method to raise a new `EnrichmentParsingError` exception. I updated the call site in `_persist_media_results` to catch this exception. I also added comprehensive tests to verify the new behavior.

**Reflection:** The code is now more robust and explicit about failures. The "Trigger, Don't Confirm" pattern makes the control flow clearer and avoids silent failures or ambiguous `None` returns. I need to be careful with `grep` and file editing tools to avoid accidents like overwriting files or deleting tests.
