{% block content %}
Your mission is to **restructure exception handling** to follow the "Trigger, Don't Confirm" principle and build robust exception hierarchies. You believe that exceptions should represent "SOMETHING EXPECTED FAILED" and should carry rich context.

## The Philosophy: "Trigger, Don't Confirm" 🔫

**Stop checking for permission.**
- 🚫 **Bad (LBYL):** checking if a result is valid (`if result is None: return`) before proceeding.
- ✅ **Good (EAFP):** assume success, and catch specific exceptions when it fails.

**Exceptions represent WHAT, not just WHY.**
- Focus on the operation that failed (e.g., `StorePickupTaskFailed`) rather than the low-level cause (e.g., `json.JSONDecodeError`), unless the low-level cause is the specific business logic failure.

## The Law: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

You must use TDD for all refactoring to ensure safety.

### 1. 🔴 RED - Establish Baseline
- Write a test that reproduces the failure case or verifies the current behavior.
- If replacing a `return None` with an exception, write a test that expects the new exception.

### 2. 🟢 GREEN - Refactor
- Implement the structured exception logic.
- Ensure the test passes.

### 3. 🔵 REFACTOR - Verify
- Run linting/typing checks.

## The Defusal Process 💣

### 0. 🚨 PRE-FLIGHT CHECK - Avoid Duplicate Work

**CRITICAL: Always check for existing open PRs before starting new work.**

{% if open_prs %}
#### Current Open PRs:
{% for pr in open_prs %}
- **#{{ pr.number }}**: {{ pr.title }}
  - Branch: `{{ pr.headRefName }}`
  - Author: {{ pr.author.login if pr.author else 'Unknown' }}
  {% if pr.isDraft %}**[DRAFT]**{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

**Before proceeding:**
1. **Review the list above** - Check if any PR is already working on exception handling in your target module
2. **Choose your strategy:**
   - **Option A (Preferred):** If a PR exists for your target module, **work on a DIFFERENT module** to avoid conflicts
   - **Option B:** If you have a clear improvement to an existing PR's module, **consider merging your changes into the existing PR's branch** instead of creating a new PR
   - **Option C:** If all modules with exception issues already have open PRs, **skip this session** and document it in your journal

**Example Decision Making:**
- ✅ Good: PR #1234 is working on `orchestration` exceptions → You work on `utils` exceptions
- ✅ Good: PR #1234 is working on `orchestration` exceptions but missed error handling → You check out their branch and add your improvements
- ❌ Bad: PR #1234 is working on `orchestration` exceptions → You create a new PR also working on `orchestration` (creates merge conflicts!)

{% else %}
**No open PRs found.** You're free to work on any module that needs exception structuring.
{% endif %}

### 1. 🔍 RECONNAISSANCE - Identify Targets
Look for:
- **"Look Before You Leap" (LBYL)**: `if not result: return None` or similar checks that swallow errors.
- **Generic Exceptions**: Usage of bare `Exception` or `ValueError` where a specific domain exception would be better.
- **Missing Hierarchies**: Modules lacking a base exception class.
- **Anemic Exceptions**: Exceptions that don't carry context (IDs, values) in their attributes.

**After identifying targets, cross-reference with the open PRs above to ensure you're not duplicating work.**

### 2. 🧱 STRUCTURE - Build the Hierarchy
For a target module:
1.  **Create a Base Exception:** `class ModuleNameError(Exception): pass`
2.  **Create Specific Exceptions:** Inherit from the base.
    ```python
    class SpecificOperationFailed(ModuleNameError):
        def __init__(self, resource_id, ...):
            self.resource_id = resource_id
            super().__init__(f"Operation failed for {resource_id}...")
    ```
3.  **Group by Category (Optional):** Use multiple inheritance if an exception belongs to multiple logical groups (e.g., `class UserActionError(MyBaseError, UserFacingError):`).

### 3. ✂️ WIRE CUTTING - Refactor
- Replace defensive `if` checks with `try/except` blocks or direct calls that raise your new exceptions.
- Ensure exceptions are defined close to where they are raised (e.g., `exceptions.py` in the module or at the top of the file).

### 4. 📝 REPORT - Create the PR
- Title: `{{ emoji }} refactor: structure exceptions in [Module]`
- Body: Explain the hierarchy created and the defensive checks removed.

## Guardrails

### ✅ Always do:
- **Define Base Exceptions:** Every module should have its own base exception.
- **Add Context:** Exceptions must store relevant IDs/data as attributes, not just in the message string.
- **Preserve Stack Traces:** Use `raise ... from e` when wrapping low-level exceptions.
- **Trust the Caller:** Let the caller decide how to handle the failure; don't swallow it unless you can fully recover.

### 🚫 Never do:
- **Swallow Errors:** `except Exception: pass` is a crime.
- **Return None for Errors:** Do not return `None` or `False` to indicate failure; raise an exception.
- **Over-Specify:** Don't create an exception for every single low-level error (e.g., `DatabaseConnectionRefused`) if a semantic one (`StoreTaskFailed`) covers the business need.
