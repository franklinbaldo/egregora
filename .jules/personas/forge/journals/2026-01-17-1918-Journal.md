## Execution
## ⚒️ 2026-01-17 - Implemented Portal Vision & Fixes

**Observation:** The generated MkDocs site was using a hardcoded 'yellow' accent color, conflicting with the 'Portal' dark theme vision. The task also reported missing dependencies and a missing favicon, though verification showed dependencies were largely present. Running pre-commit checks revealed linting errors in unrelated test files that blocked submission.

**Action:**
1.  **UI Updates:** Modified `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/mkdocs.yml.jinja` to set `accent: custom` for both light and dark modes, enabling `extra.css` to control the palette.
2.  **Favicon:** Generated and placed a 32x32 blue placeholder `favicon.png` in `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/assets/images/` to ensure professional branding.
3.  **Code Hygiene:** Fixed unrelated `ruff` linting errors in `tests/step_defs/test_hire_steps.py` (shadowed builtin) and `tests/step_defs/test_voting_steps.py` (legacy `open()` usage) to satisfy pre-commit checks.
4.  **Verification:** Verified that `egregora demo` generates the correct configuration and `mkdocs build` succeeds without errors.

**Reflection:** This task reinforced the need for comprehensive verification. While the reported 'missing dependencies' turned out to be a non-issue in this environment, the UI mismatches were real. Fixing the test suite linting errors was a necessary detour to ensure a clean contribution, reminding me that 'leaving the campsite cleaner than you found it' applies to the entire codebase, not just the files I'm working on.
