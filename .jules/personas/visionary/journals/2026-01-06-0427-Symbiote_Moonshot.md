## 🔮 2026-01-06 - Moonshot + Quick Win: Egregora Symbiote & Real-Time Framework
**The Napkin Sketch (Rejected Ideas):**
- **The Council of Egregora:** Combine multiple LLM agents (a historian, a skeptic, a futurist) to analyze chat logs and produce a "Council discussion" as a blog post. Too much of a gimmick, doesn't fundamentally change the interaction model.
- **Proactive Context Injection:** Instead of a full bot, have Egregora proactively push "related reading" links from the blog into a dedicated side-channel or DM. Less disruptive, but also less value. It's a feature, not a paradigm shift.
- **Egregora as a Simulation Engine:** Use the chat data to model communication patterns and predict project risks or team burnout. Academically interesting, but the value proposition for the end-user is too abstract.

**Selected Moonshot:** [Egregora Symbiote](../../../../RFCs/018-egregora-symbiote.md)
**Selected Quick Win:** [Real-Time Adapter Framework](../../../../RFCs/019-real-time-adapter-framework.md)

**Why this pairing works:** The Symbiote represents a fundamental shift from passive analysis to active participation. It's a tangible, high-value expression of a real-time Egregora. The Real-Time Adapter Framework is the absolute prerequisite for this vision. It's the non-negotiable first step, de-risking the entire concept by focusing on the core technical challenge: breaking free from batch processing. By building the framework first, we pave the way for the Scribe and all future real-time agents.
