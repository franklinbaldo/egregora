## 🔮 2025-12-24 - Moonshot: Egregora Symbiote
**The Napkin Sketch (Rejected Ideas):**
- **The Council of Egregora:** Combine multiple LLM agents (a historian, a skeptic, a futurist) to analyze chat logs and produce a "Council discussion" as a blog post. Too much of a gimmick, doesn't fundamentally change the interaction model.
- **Proactive Context Injection:** Instead of a full bot, have Egregora proactively push "related reading" links from the blog into a dedicated side-channel or DM. Less disruptive, but also less value. It's a feature, not a paradigm shift.
- **Egregora as a Simulation Engine:** Use the chat data to model communication patterns and predict project risks or team burnout. Academically interesting, but the value proposition for the end-user is too abstract.
