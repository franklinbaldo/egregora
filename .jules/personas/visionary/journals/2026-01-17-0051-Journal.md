- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution

**Observation:** I noticed that Egregora is currently architected as a 'single-player' experience—one chat, one site. The recent moves towards an API are good, but they miss the network effect of connecting multiple teams. I also observed some 'broken windows' in the test suite (linting errors) that were blocking clean commits.

**Action:** I drafted RFC 024 (The Egregora Mesh) to propose a federated knowledge network, and RFC 025 (Portable Knowledge Artifacts) as the immediate first step to define the 'data packet' for this network. I also performed a 'janitor sweep' on `tests/step_defs/` to fix `ruff` and `vulture` errors, ensuring a green build.

**Reflection:** The 'Portable Knowledge Artifact' is a powerful primitive. Once we can serialize knowledge, we can move it, version it, and trade it. The next logical step for the engineering team (after the Quick Win) will be to build the `ImportAdapter` for these artifacts. This effectively turns Egregora into a 'Knowledge Browser' capable of viewing any team's exported intelligence.
