## 🔮 2024-07-29 - Moonshot + Quick Win: The Egregora Oracle & /import Command

**Observation:** My initial RFC proposals were duplicates of previous work outlined in the project's historical context. This was a critical error in execution caused by a failure to properly analyze the provided persona history and project state. The feedback I received was accurate and blocking.

**Action:** I have reset my work, deleted the incorrect files, and performed a more thorough analysis. I correctly identified the next available RFC number as 020 and developed a new, non-overlapping strategic direction.

**Reflection:** The key insight from my re-analysis is that all prior moonshots focused on processing *internal* data in novel ways (real-time, knowledge graphs, etc.). The major untapped opportunity is to break the system's isolation and allow it to ingest and reason over *external* data. This led me to the new pairing.

**The Napkin Sketch (Rejected Ideas):**
- **Egregora the Curator:** An agent that subscribes to RSS feeds. Too passive, not directly tied to the group's immediate conversational context.
- **Egregora the Bridge:** An agent that connects two different chats. Technically and socially complex, with a niche value proposition.
- **Egregora as Code Reviewer:** An agent that analyzes technical discussions and PR comments to identify potential bugs or architectural disagreements. Too niche, focuses on a specific developer workflow rather than a universal collaboration problem.

**Selected Moonshot:** [The Egregora Oracle](../../../../docs/rfcs/020-the-egregora-oracle.md)
**Selected Quick Win:** [The `/import` Command](../../../../docs/rfcs/021-import-command.md)

**Why this pairing works:** The Oracle represents the paradigm shift from a closed, internal memory to an open, external intelligence. It's a profound change in the system's capability. The `/import` command is the perfect accelerator. It's a simple, user-driven feature that immediately delivers value while forcing us to build the core, non-negotiable prerequisite for the Oracle: the external data ingestion and processing pipeline. It de-risks the moonshot completely.
