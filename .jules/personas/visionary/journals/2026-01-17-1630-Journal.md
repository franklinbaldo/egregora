## Execution
## 🔭 2026-01-16 - Moonshot + Quick Win: The Egregora Simulator & Persona Extraction

**Observation:** Egregora is currently a passive archivist. It records history well but doesn't use that deep knowledge to help teams predict the future or resolve conflicts.

**Action:**
1. **Moonshot RFC:** Proposed The Egregora Simulator (RFC 024).
2. **Quick Win RFC:** Proposed Structured Persona Extraction (RFC 025).
3. **Implementation:** Created PersonaModel, PersonaAgent, and 'egregora persona analyze' CLI command.

**Reflection:** The Persona is the atomic unit of the Simulator. By shipping this quick win, we unlock immediate value while building the critical data layer for the future simulation engine.
