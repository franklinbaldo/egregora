## 🔮 2026-01-04 - Moonshot + Quick Win: Cognitive Modeler & Health Scorecard
***Note: This entry supersedes a previous attempt that was rejected for proposing duplicative, non-novel ideas. This represents a corrected, genuinely new strategic direction.***

**The Napkin Sketch (Rejected Ideas):**
- **Egregora as a Team Coach:** An agent that gives prescriptive advice on communication. This felt too intrusive and high-risk. The Cognitive Modeler provides the data for the *team* to decide, which is more empowering.
- **Sentiment Analysis as the Moonshot:** Focusing solely on sentiment is too narrow. It's one feature of a much richer model of communication dynamics.
- **The "Devil's Advocate" Agent:** An agent that automatically argues against the prevailing consensus to improve decision-making. A powerful idea, but too complex and socially risky for a first moonshot in this direction.

**Selected Moonshot:** [Egregora as a Cognitive Modeler](../../../../RFCs/018-cognitive-modeler.md)
**Selected Quick Win:** [Conversation Health Scorecard](../../../../RFCs/019-health-scorecard.md)

**Why this pairing works:** The Cognitive Modeler is a true paradigm shift, moving Egregora from a content-archivist to a dynamics-analyzer. It creates an entirely new category of value. The Health Scorecard is the perfect entry point. It's a simple, high-impact feature that can be implemented on the current architecture, but it immediately introduces the core concept of analyzing *how* a team communicates. It delivers instant value while building the technical and conceptual foundation for the far more ambitious modeling engine.
