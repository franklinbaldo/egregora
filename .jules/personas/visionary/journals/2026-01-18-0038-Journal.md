## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: Studied the current RFCs. Saw a trend towards structure (Decision Ledger) and platformization (API). The missing piece is navigation and synthesis. We are still stuck in the 'feed' metaphor. Action: Proposed 'The Egregora Atlas' (Moonshot) to turn time into space. Proposed 'Semantic Topic Modeling' (Quick Win) to prove we can structure chaos. Reflection: The technology for the Quick Win is already present (lancedb, scikit-learn). The Moonshot is ambitious but is the logical conclusion of having a 'Group Mind' - it should be a place you can visit.
