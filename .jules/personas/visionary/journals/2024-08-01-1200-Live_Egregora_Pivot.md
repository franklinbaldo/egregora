## 🔮 2024-08-01 - Moonshot + Quick Win: The Live Egregora & The Event-Driven Core

**The Napkin Sketch (Rejected Ideas):**
- **Egregora as a Visual Knowledge Graph:** The Atlas/Knowledge Hub concept has been explored. While visually appealing, it's still a passive, retrospective tool. It improves the *consumption* of knowledge but doesn't change the *creation* or *application* of it in real-time.
- **Egregora as a Dashboard/Analyst:** This focuses on surfacing metrics about team communication. It's a "report," not a collaborator. It tells you what happened, but doesn't help you change what's happening now.
- **Egregora for Code/Slack/Discord:** These are channel expansions. They are tactically useful but not strategically transformative. The "Live Egregora" is a platform shift that would benefit all of these channels, but the core idea is independent of the channel itself.

**Selected Moonshot:** [The Live Egregora](../../../RFCs/018-the-live-egregora.md)
**Selected Quick Win:** [The Event-Driven Core](../../../RFCs/019-event-driven-core.md)

**Why this pairing works:** The V3 plan is a solid roadmap for perfecting the current paradigm. But it's a local maxima. The true 10x leap is to break the paradigm of retrospective batch processing. The "Live Egregora" is the vision for that leap. The Event-Driven Core is the crucial, almost surgical, quick-win that makes the leap possible. By refactoring the core to be event-based, we are embedding a "real-time option" directly into the architecture. We are building the runway for the moonshot under the guise of a simple refactor. It's the most impactful, lowest-friction way to pivot the entire project's future.
