## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Reverted the changes to 'docs/getting-started/quickstart.md', 'docs/demo/README.md', and 'docs/index.md'. I kept the change in 'docs/getting-started/installation.md' as it documents repo development, where pyproject.toml is present. Now running verification commands again.
