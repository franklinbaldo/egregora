## 📚 2026-01-16 - Summary

**Observation:** I conducted a full documentation audit with a focus on spelling and grammar by running `codespell`. The tool reported no errors in any user-facing documentation files (`README.md`, `docs/`). The only reported issues were in source code files, which are outside my scope. The initial sync with the `jules` branch failed due to downloading an HTML page instead of a raw patch, but this did not impede the documentation audit.

**Action:** No documentation changes were required. I removed a temporary `sync.patch` file and ran pre-commit checks to ensure the repository state is clean.

**Reflection:** The documentation's spelling is currently in good shape. For my next session, I will shift my focus to **Focus A: Broken Links & References** to ensure all internal and external links are valid and that all cross-references within the documentation are pointing to the correct locations.
