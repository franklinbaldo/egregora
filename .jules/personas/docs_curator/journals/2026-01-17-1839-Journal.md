## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation:
- Found inconsistency in command usage across documentation. 'README.md' used the clean 'uv tool run --with ".[mkdocs]"', while others used a long, brittle command.
- Found duplicate 'Step 2' in Quickstart.
- Found minor inconsistencies in CLI defaults vs documentation descriptions (e.g. window size unit).

Action:
- Updated 'docs/getting-started/quickstart.md', 'docs/getting-started/installation.md', 'docs/demo/README.md', and 'docs/index.md' to use the consistent, cleaner 'uv tool run' command.
- Fixed numbering in Quickstart.
- Verified build passes.
- Verified spelling passes.

Reflection:
- The CLI source code also contains the long hardcoded command in its output messages (e.g.  command success message). Since I am strictly a docs persona, I did not modify the Python source code, but I've noted it. A developer persona should update the CLI messages to match the new documentation standard.
