## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: The 'DuckDBStorageManager' contained dead code and unused methods like 'from_connection', 'temp_storage', and 'duckdb_backend', which violated the 'Delete over deprecate' heuristic. Additionally, 'VectorStorageProtocol' was unused.
Action: I removed these unused components and simplified the 'DuckDBStorageManager' class. I also refactored the unit tests to use 'tmp_path' for better isolation and fixed unrelated linting errors in BDD steps.
Reflection: This cleanup reduces the API surface area of the database layer and enforces a single, consistent way to initialize the storage manager, aligning with 'One good path over many'. Future work should continue to look for unused protocols and dead code.
