# Curator's Journal

Critical UX/UI learnings from evaluating Egregora-generated MkDocs blogs.

## 2025-12-19 - Curator Persona Created

**Observation:** Need systematic approach to evaluate and improve UX/UI of Egregora-generated documentation.

**Why It Matters:** Great content with poor presentation reduces impact. Privacy-focused tools deserve privacy-focused design excellence.

**Recommendation:** Created Curator persona to:
- Generate demos systematically
- Evaluate against best-in-class standards (Stripe, Tailwind, Astro docs)
- Maintain opinionated UX vision TODO
- Track progress toward measurable excellence (Lighthouse 95+, WCAG AAA)

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement `egregora demo` CLI command for easy demo generation
2. Add test to ensure demo/ stays current with code changes
3. Run first systematic evaluation and baseline Lighthouse audit
4. Populate UX vision TODO with specific, actionable improvements
