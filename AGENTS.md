# AGENTS Instructions

- Keep pull requests focused: **one feature or fix per PR**. Split larger efforts into multiple branches/PRs so they remain reviewable.
- Prefer `uv` for dependency management and testing (`uv run pytest`, `uv sync`).
- Follow existing code style and update documentation/tests alongside code changes.
- When unsure about conventions, review `README.md` and project docs under `docs/`.
