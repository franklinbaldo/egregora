# User Journey: The Blog Reader's Experience

This document outlines the "Happy Path" for a reader visiting an Egregora-generated blog. In technical terms, this is a **User Journey** or **User Experience (UX) Flow**.

## Phase 1: Discovery & Entry

- **Landing on Home**: The reader arrives at the home page (`index.md`).
- **First Impression**: They see the "Living Notebook" branding and a curated list of "Latest Posts".
- **Call to Action**: They are drawn to a specific post title or summary that piques their interest.

## Phase 2: Engaging with Content

- **Deep Reading**: The reader clicks a post. They experience a clean, distraction-free reading environment (optimized width, high-contrast typography).
- **Contextual Awareness**:
  - They encounter a name (UUID) and hover to see a participant's profile summary.
  - They see an enriched media item (image/video/link) and click it to see the AI-generated context that explains why it was relevant to the conversation.
- **Following the Thread**: They use the sidebar or tag library to find related posts, moving from a specific anecdote to a broader philosophical theme.

## Phase 3: Exploring the "Egregore" (The Collective)

- **The Profiles Page**: Curious about the "characters," the reader visits the **Participant Profiles** index.
- **Visual Mapping**: The colorful avatars provide a visual anchor for the recurring voices. They click a profile to see that participant's "Topic Orbit" and their specific contributions.
- **Media Library**: They visit the media index to see the visual "vibe" of the group's history, organized into audio, video, and image archives.

## Phase 4: Integration

- **Search**: The reader uses the instant search to find a specific keyword or memory mentioned in passing.
- **Navigation**: They use the "Top" button or "Navigation Progress Bar" to move effortlessly through long-form essays.
- **Closure**: They arrive at the footer, see the Egregora branding, and understand that this cohesive blog was distilled from a chaotic chat.

## Technical Design Goals (Supporting the Journey)

- **Instant Response**: Navigation is near-instant thanks to prefetching.
- **Privacy as a Feature**: Anonymization doesn't feel like a "lack of data" but like a "mysterious collective" (an *egregore*).
- **AI as a Curator**: The "User Journey" is guided by the AI's ability to turn noise (WhatsApp) into signal (Essays).
