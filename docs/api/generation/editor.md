# Editor API

The editor agent revises generated drafts, applying style corrections and policy enforcement.

## Responsibilities
- Accept writer output and apply post-processing rules.
- Integrate annotation feedback for iterative refinement.
- Produce clean, publishable markdown with consistent frontmatter.

Details on configuration and prompt parameters will be added as the module matures.
