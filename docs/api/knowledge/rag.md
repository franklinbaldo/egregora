# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

The RAG surface handles embedding, indexing, and retrieval for enriched message content.

## Overview
- Manage vector indexes and metadata for message windows.
- Support deterministic cache invalidation for enrichment changes.
- Provide search utilities consumed by writer and editor agents.

Implementation details will be expanded with code links and query examples.
