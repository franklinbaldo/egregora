# Privacy Detector

The detector identifies potential PII before anonymization occurs.

## Capabilities
- Flag candidate entities for masking or hashing.
- Provide structured signals to inform adapter-level privacy choices.
- Integrate with observability to trace decisions per message.

Detailed thresholds and rule sets will be added as the privacy gate solidifies.
