# Pipeline Orchestration

The orchestration layer coordinates ingestion, enrichment, retrieval, and generation into deterministic runs.

## Responsibilities
- Manage stage execution order and inter-stage contracts.
- Expose hooks for cache invalidation and reruns.
- Record run metadata for observability and debugging.

Examples for programmatic usage and extension points will be added as the orchestrator stabilizes.
