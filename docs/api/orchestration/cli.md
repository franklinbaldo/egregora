# CLI Reference

The `egregora` CLI drives ingestion, enrichment, generation, and publishing workflows from the command line.

## Highlights
- `egregora init` scaffolds an output directory with the required assets.
- `egregora write` executes the pipeline with tiered cache refresh controls.
- Additional subcommands for debugging and validation will be documented here.

Command-by-command examples and option tables will be added in future revisions.
