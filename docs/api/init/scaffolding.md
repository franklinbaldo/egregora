# Scaffolding API

The scaffolding utilities initialize an output directory with templates, assets, and configuration needed to publish the site.

## Capabilities
- Create deterministic directory structures for generated content.
- Provide defaults for prompts, CSS, and layouts.
- Support idempotent re-runs when scaffolding already exists.

Examples for CLI usage and programmatic calls will be added as the tooling settles.
