# Core Models

The core models provide typed structures for messages, annotations, and pipeline context.

## Responsibilities
- Encapsulate validation and defaults for runtime objects.
- Keep agent inputs consistent across adapters and writers.
- Serve as the source of truth for API documentation.

Field summaries and construction patterns will be fleshed out in this page.
