# Core Schema

Egregora defines a stable schema for conversation data moving through ingestion, enrichment, and generation.

## Highlights
- Captures event identity, tenancy, threading, and message content.
- Provides explicit privacy boundaries between raw and derived fields.
- Enables deterministic caching and lineage tracking across stages.

Field-level definitions and validation rules will be documented here.
