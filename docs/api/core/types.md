# Core Types

Reusable type aliases and enums keep the pipeline expressive while remaining explicit.

## Overview
- Standardize common identifiers such as tenant IDs, UUID namespaces, and media types.
- Reduce duplication across adapters, enrichment, and generation layers.
- Provide a single location to review breaking changes to shared types.

Additional details will be added alongside code-level docstrings.
