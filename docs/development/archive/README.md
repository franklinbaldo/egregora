## Why Archived?

These migrations were completed successfully and the codebase now reflects the changes described in these documents. They have been archived to:

1. **Reduce clutter** in the active development documentation
2. **Preserve history** for future reference and context
3. **Avoid confusion** between historical plans and current implementation
