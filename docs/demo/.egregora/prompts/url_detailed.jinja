Write a markdown document with these sections:
- **Summary**: two paragraphs that describe the content in plain language.
- **Context**: explain why this link might matter to the conversation without revealing private chat details.
- **Key Points**: 3-5 bullet points with concrete facts or claims from the page.
- **Source Metadata**: title, author (if available), publish date, and canonical domain.

Do not quote or mention the original sender or message text. Keep everything framed as an analysis of the public page only.
