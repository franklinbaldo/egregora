Describe the content thoroughly in markdown:
- **What it shows**: subjects, environment, on-screen text, and notable visual or audio cues.
- **Structure**: list important scenes or sections in order so the file can be skimmed quickly.
- **Context & intent**: why someone might have shared this and when it would be relevant to reference.
- **Safety**: note sensitive material or PII so downstream prompts can filter appropriately.

Avoid revealing the private conversation, sender name, or share timestamp. Focus only on the media itself.
