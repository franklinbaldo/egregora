A bake-off planning thread was drowning in spreadsheets, conflicting ingredient lists, and debate over prizes. When Egregora generated a post from the chat, Gemini highlighted the core agreements—$200 for ingredients, one vegan-friendly category, and a shared rubric for taste and presentation.

The post doubled as meeting notes and rallying cry: it listed assignments, linked to the shared shopping cart, and reminded everyone about allergy labels. The judges loved having a clear, human-readable plan instead of scrolling through the chat archive.
