# Egregora

**Personal knowledge graph from your digital traces.**

Egregora transforms your personal data (WhatsApp exports, Slack history, etc.) into a rich, searchable knowledge graph with privacy-first anonymization. Built as a staged pipeline that enriches your data with AI insights while keeping PII at bay.

## What is Egregora?

Egregora is a personal knowledge management tool that takes your digital traces - messages, documents, interactions - and transforms them into a structured, searchable knowledge graph. It's designed with privacy as the core principle, ensuring your personal information never leaves your machine.

## Key Features

- **Privacy-First**: All PII detection and anonymization happens locally on your machine
- **Multi-Source**: Import from WhatsApp, Slack, and more
- **AI Enrichment**: Automatic enrichment with topics, sentiment, and relationships
- **Knowledge Graph**: Organize your data into a searchable knowledge base
- **Flexible Output**: Generate documentation, journals, or export to various formats

## How It Works

Egregora processes your data through a staged pipeline:

1. **Input**: Import from various sources (WhatsApp, Slack, etc.)
2. **Privacy**: Detect and anonymize personal information
3. **Enrichment**: AI-powered enrichment with context and insights
4. **Output**: Generate your knowledge graph in your preferred format
