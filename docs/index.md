# Egregora

Egregora turns chat archives into a structured, readable blog. It parses your export,
groups conversations into time windows, and generates posts that you can publish as a
static site with MkDocs.

## Quick links

- Demo site: https://franklinbaldo.github.io/egregora/demo/

## How it works

1. Initialize a site scaffold with `egregora init`.
2. Run `egregora write` on your WhatsApp export.
3. Preview the generated blog with MkDocs.

Egregora is designed to run locally with privacy-first defaults while letting you
choose modern LLMs for writing and enrichment.
