# About Egregora

Egregora is an open-source tool designed to reclaim your digital history from the walled gardens of chat applications.

## Mission

Our digital lives are increasingly fragmented across proprietary platforms. "Egregora" (derived from *egregore*) represents the distinct psychic entity that emerges from a collective group.

This project aims to:

1. **Preserve** your chat archives in a future-proof, plain-text format.
2. **Respect Privacy** by processing everything locally.
3. **Synthesize** meaning from noise using local or private AI.

## The Team

Egregora is built by [Franklin Baldo](https://github.com/franklinbaldo) and open-source contributors.
