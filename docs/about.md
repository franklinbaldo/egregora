# About Egregora

Egregora is an open-source engine designed to transform raw information streams into structured, intelligent knowledge feeds. It acts as a "Group Mind" synthesizer, reclaiming your digital history from walled gardens and turning it into a living, queryable knowledge base.

## Mission

Our digital lives are fragmented across proprietary platforms and ephemeral feeds. "Egregora" (derived from *egregore*) represents the distinct psychic entity that emerges from a collective group.

This project aims to:
1.  **Preserve** history in open, future-proof formats (Atom/RSS, Markdown, Parquet).
2.  **Synthesize** signal from noise using composable AI agents.
3.  **Empower** individuals to own their algorithms and data pipelines.

## Inspirations

Egregora is spiritually inspired by tools that empowered user-driven data composition:

*   **Yahoo Pipes:** For the vision of visual, user-defined data flow and transformation.
*   **Google Reader:** For the ideal of a centralized, user-controlled consumption interface.
*   **Atom Protocol:** For the robust, decentralized standard of information exchange.

## The Team

Egregora is built by [Franklin Baldo](https://github.com/franklinbaldo) and open-source contributors.
