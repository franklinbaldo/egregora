# Annotations API

Annotations capture reviewer notes and structured feedback alongside messages and generated outputs.

## Responsibilities
- Persist commentary and tags alongside message events.
- Expose lookup helpers used by ranking and regeneration flows.
- Allow adapters to opt into privacy validation where required.

More usage examples will be documented as the API stabilizes.
