# API Reference

This section documents the main public interfaces that power Egregora's ingestion, privacy, knowledge, generation, and orchestration flows.

Use the subsections in the navigation to find the component you need:

- **Ingestion** covers parsers and adapters that transform raw exports into the internal representation.
- **Privacy** describes anonymization and detection helpers used to safeguard sensitive data.
- **Knowledge** outlines vector search, annotations, and ranking surfaces for retrieval.
- **Generation** documents the writer/editor agents responsible for producing content.
- **Publication & Orchestration** explains scaffolding, pipeline coordination, and CLI entry points.

Each page is a work in progress while we expand the consolidated documentation set.
