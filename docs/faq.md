# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some common questions about using Egregora to preserve your family memories.

## 🔒 Privacy & Safety

### Is my chat history sent to the internet?
**No.** Egregora runs entirely on your own computer. Your full chat history is never uploaded to any cloud server or company database.

The only data that leaves your computer are small snippets sent to the AI (Google Gemini) to generate the stories. We anonymize names before doing this to protect your privacy.

### Can anyone else see my blog?
**No.** By default, the blog exists only on your computer. It is just a collection of files in a folder. You can choose to publish it to the web later if you want, but that is 100% under your control.

## 💰 Costs

### Is Egregora free?
The software itself is free and open source.

However, to generate the stories, you need an "API Key" from Google or another AI provider.
*   **Google Gemini** has a generous free tier that is enough for most personal projects.
*   **Paid tiers** are very affordable (typically under $5 for a huge chat history).

## 🛠️ Usage

### Do I need to be a programmer?
**Not at all!** While Egregora is a powerful tool, you only need to run 3 simple commands to get started. We have designed it with sensible defaults so it "just works" for 95% of users.

### Can I edit the stories?
**Yes!** Every story is saved as a simple text file (Markdown) on your computer. You can open them, edit them, delete them, or add your own pictures just like any other file.

### What happens if I have a huge chat history?
Egregora is built to handle years of conversation. The first time you run it, it might take a while (grab a coffee!), but after that, adding new messages is very fast.
