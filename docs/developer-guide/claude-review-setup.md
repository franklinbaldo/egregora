# Claude Code Review Setup

This document explains how Claude Code Review is configured for the Egregora project.

## Overview

Claude automatically reviews code changes to ensure quality, security, and consistency with the project architecture.

## Review Triggers

### Automatic Reviews
- **Target**: Pull requests to `main` branch
- **When**: Opened, updated, or reopened
- **Scope**: Full code review with security focus

### Manual Reviews
- **Target**: Any pull request
- **Trigger**: Comment `@claude review` on the PR
- **Permissions**: Only users with write access can trigger
- **Alternative**: Manual workflow dispatch from Actions tab

## Configuration

### Required Secrets

Set these in your repository settings:

```bash
# Required for Claude API
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Automatically available
GITHUB_TOKEN=<automatic>
```

### Workflow Files

- `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml` - Main review workflow
- `.github/workflows/manual-claude-review.yml` - Comment trigger
- `.github/scripts/claude-review.py` - Review logic

## Review Focus Areas

Claude reviews focus on:

### üîí Security & Privacy
- **Critical**: Phone number leaks and PII exposure
- Anonymization verification
- Secret detection
- Input validation

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture
- Consistency with Polars DataFrame pipeline
- Configuration management patterns
- Separation of concerns
- Integration patterns

### üêç Code Quality
- Python best practices
- Type hints and documentation
- Error handling
- Performance considerations

### üó£Ô∏è Egregora-Specific
- WhatsApp parsing correctness
- AI/LLM integration
- RAG and embedding workflows
- Media handling
- Multi-language support

## Usage Examples

### Automatic Review (PRs to main)
```bash
# Create PR to main - review runs automatically
gh pr create --base main --title "Fix privacy leak"
```

### Manual Review (Other branches)
```bash
# Create PR to dev branch
gh pr create --base dev --title "WIP: New feature"

# Request manual review
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "@claude review"
```

### Workflow Dispatch
```bash
# Trigger review manually via CLI
gh workflow run claude-code-review.yml -f pr_number=123
```

## Review Output

Claude provides structured feedback:

1. **Overall Assessment** - Approve/Request Changes/Comment
2. **Security Concerns** - üîí CRITICAL issues highlighted
3. **Major Issues** - Blocking problems
4. **Minor Issues** - Improvement suggestions
5. **Positive Feedback** - Good practices noted

## Troubleshooting

### Review Not Triggering
- Check that PR targets `main` for automatic reviews
- Verify user has write access for manual reviews
- Check Actions tab for workflow status

### API Errors
- Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set correctly
- Check API key has sufficient credits
- Review rate limits in workflow logs

### Large PRs
- Reviews limited to 20 files max
- Diff truncated at 50,000 characters
- Binary files and large files skipped

## Customization

### Modify Review Criteria
Edit `.github/scripts/claude-review.py`:
```python
# Adjust file size limits
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10000

# Add ignored file types
IGNORED_EXTENSIONS = {'.png', '.jpg', '.lock'}

# Modify review prompt
def create_review_prompt(...):
    # Customize review guidelines
```

### Change Trigger Branches
Edit `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml`:
```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main      # Add other branches here
      - release   # for automatic reviews
```

## Best Practices

### For Developers
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- Include clear descriptions and test information
- Address security feedback promptly
- Use manual reviews for experimental branches

### For Maintainers
- Review Claude feedback alongside human review
- Pay special attention to üîí CRITICAL security issues
- Use review insights to improve coding standards
- Monitor API usage and costs

## Limitations

- Maximum 20 files per review
- Binary files excluded
- Large files (>10KB) skipped
- No real-time interaction during review
- API rate limits may delay reviews
