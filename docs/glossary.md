# Glossary of Terms

We know that some of the words used in Egregora might sound like "tech speak". Here is a simple guide to what they mean.

## 🔑 API Key
Think of this like a **digital password** that allows Egregora to talk to the AI (Google Gemini). It's a long string of letters and numbers. You need to get one from Google (it's free) so that the AI can read your chats and write stories.
*   **Is it safe?** Yes. You only save it on your own computer.

## 📦 Chat Export (Zip File)
This is just the file you get from WhatsApp when you choose "Export Chat".
*   It's a compressed folder (ZIP) that contains a text file of your messages.
*   Egregora reads this file to find your memories.

## 💻 Terminal (Command Line)
The "black box" window where you type commands. On Windows, it's called **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt**. On Mac, it's called **Terminal**.
*   Don't be afraid of it! You just need to copy and paste the commands we give you.

## 🏠 Local Server (Preview)
When we say "start a local server," we mean "make a private website on your computer."
*   It looks like a real website in your browser (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`), but it **only exists on your machine**.
*   If you turn off your computer, the website stops running. No one on the internet can see it.

## 📝 Markdown
This is the simple format Egregora uses to save your stories.
*   It's just plain text with simple symbols for formatting (like `**bold**` or `# Heading`).
*   You can open these files with any text editor (Notepad, TextEdit) to change your stories.

## 🤖 Model (AI)
The "brain" that reads your messages and writes the stories.
*   Egregora uses **Google Gemini** by default because it's fast, smart, and has a great free tier.
