## Philosophy

Egregora v2 is built on the principle of **trusting the LLM**. Instead of micromanaging with complex agents and heuristics, we give the LLM the data and let it make editorial decisions. The result is ~500 lines of code that does more than thousands of lines of agent-based architecture.

Learn more in the [Architecture Overview](guides/architecture.md).
