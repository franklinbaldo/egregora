# 🎭 Curator's UX Vision for Egregora

This document outlines the user experience and user interface (UX/UI) vision for the blogs generated by Egregora. It is a living document, developed and maintained by the Curator persona.

## Core Principles

1.  **Content-First:** The design must prioritize readability and the clear presentation of the generated content. All other design elements are secondary.
2.  **Autonomously Generated, Professionally Presented:** The blog is generated 100% autonomously, but it should not look like it. The final output must be polished, professional, and indistinguishable from a high-quality, human-curated site.
3.  **Privacy-First by Default:** The user's privacy is paramount. Features that could compromise privacy (like analytics) must be opt-in, never on by default.
4.  **Measurable Quality:** All UX decisions should be backed by data where possible. We will use tools like Lighthouse to measure and track our progress on accessibility, performance, and SEO.
5.  **Accessible to All:** The final site must be usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities. We will adhere to WCAG AA standards as a minimum baseline.

## Technical & Architectural Discoveries

### Template Architecture

**CRITICAL FINDING:** The templates for the MkDocs site are **not** standalone `.html` or `.jinja2` files. They are embedded as triple-quoted strings within the Python source code.

This has significant implications for how we work:
-   **Forge Persona:** All UX/UI changes will require modifying Python files, not just HTML/CSS.
-   **Curator Persona:** My tasks must be extremely precise, pointing to the exact Python file and even the specific function or variable that contains the template string.

The key locations for these embedded templates are:
-   `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/scaffolding.py`: Generates `mkdocs.yml` and the core site structure.
-   `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/adapter.py`: Generates the individual Markdown pages for posts, profiles, etc.
-   `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/site_generator.py`: Orchestrates the assembly of the site and generation of summary pages.

## Design System (V1 - Inception)

This section will evolve over time to become a full design system.

### Color Palette
-   **Status:** Defined.
-   **Primary:** A deep, thoughtful blue (`#2c3e50`) to represent intellect and depth.
-   **Accent:** A vibrant, energetic yellow (`#f9d423`) to represent emergence and growth.
-   **Implementation:** The palette is implemented in `demo/docs/stylesheets/extra.css`, but the `mkdocs.yml` still contains the default `teal` and `amber` values. These should be updated to `custom` to match the CSS.

### Typography
-   **Status:** Defined.
-   **Fonts:** `Outfit` for headings and `Inter` for body text.
-   **Implementation:** The fonts are imported and applied in `demo/docs/stylesheets/extra.css`.

### Favicon
-   **Status:** Missing.
-   **Next Action:** Design a favicon for the project.

### Social Cards
-   **Status:** Broken.
-   **Issue:** The social card generation is failing with 404 errors for the card images.
-   **Next Action:** The Forge persona needs to investigate and fix the root cause of the 404 errors.

### Navigation
-   **Status:** Implemented, but needs review.
-   **Issue:** The main navigation is functional, but the "Media" page is a placeholder and may not be the most logical top-level item.
-   **Next Action:** Review the information architecture and consider restructuring the navigation for better clarity.
