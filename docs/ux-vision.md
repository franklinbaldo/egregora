# UX Vision: Egregora Blogs

This document outlines the user experience (UX) vision for blogs generated by Egregora. It serves as a guiding star for all frontend development and design decisions, ensuring a consistent, high-quality, and privacy-first reading experience.

## Core Principles

1.  **Reading First:** The primary goal is to provide an exceptional reading experience. This means prioritizing content clarity, readability, and focus. All design choices should serve the reader.
2.  **Privacy by Design:** The blog frontend will be a fortress of privacy. No external trackers, no unnecessary JavaScript, and self-hosted assets are the default. We empower users by protecting their data.
3.  **Performant by Default:** Speed is a feature. We will strive for top-tier Lighthouse scores by optimizing assets, using modern formats, and minimizing the client-side footprint.
4.  **Accessible to All:** Our blogs must be usable by everyone, regardless of ability. We adhere to WCAG AA standards as a baseline and test for keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
5.  **Autonomously Generated, Beautifully Presented:** The blog is generated without human intervention. The templates must be robust and elegant, transforming raw data into a polished, professional-looking site.

## Technical Implementation

### Template Architecture

The foundation of our UX is the MkDocs template set. All theme files, partials, and configuration templates are located within the Egregora source code to ensure that every generated blog inherits these improvements.

-   **Template Source Location:** `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/`

This directory contains the Jinja2 templates for `mkdocs.yml`, custom theme overrides, stylesheets, and all other assets required to build the blog. Changes made here will propagate to all generated sites.

### Customization Strategy

We will leverage the **Material for MkDocs** theme as our base, customizing it through its recommended mechanisms:

-   **Configuration (`mkdocs.yml.jinja`):** Enabling and disabling features, setting color palettes, and configuring plugins.
-   **Theme Overrides (`overrides/`):** Replacing specific template partials (e.g., `main.html`, `footer.html`) for structural changes.
-   **Custom Stylesheets (`docs/stylesheets/`):** Adding a `extra.css` for visual tweaks, typographic improvements, and spacing adjustments.

We will avoid forking the theme to ensure long-term maintainability and easy access to upstream updates.
