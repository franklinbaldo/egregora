## Vision Statement

Egregora-generated MkDocs blogs should be the most beautiful, readable,
and delightful documentation in the privacy-first AI space. Users should
feel confident, informed, and respected.

## Discovered Patterns

This section will be populated with validated design patterns and best practices as they are discovered through the Curation Cycle.

### Template Architecture

- The source templates for the MkDocs site are located in `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/`.
- Key files include `mkdocs.yml.jinja` for configuration and the `overrides/` directory for theme customizations.
