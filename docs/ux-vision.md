# 🎭 Curator's UX Vision for Egregora

This document outlines the design principles and long-term vision for the user experience of blogs generated by Egregora. It is a living document, maintained by the Curator persona (🎭), that will evolve as the system matures.

## Core Principles

1.  **Content First, Chrome Second:** The primary goal is to create an exceptional reading experience. Design choices should prioritize content clarity, readability, and engagement over flashy, distracting UI elements.
2.  **Autonomously Beautiful:** Every aesthetic element must be 100% generatable by Egregora from the source data. We will never require human intervention to populate a design feature. The beauty should emerge from the data itself.
3.  **Privacy-Respecting by Default:** The user's privacy is paramount. We will not include features that track users (like analytics) by default. Any such features must be explicitly opt-in.
4.  **Distinctly Egregora:** While we build on the excellent foundation of Material for MkDocs, our goal is to create a look and feel that is uniquely identifiable with Egregora, reflecting the idea of a "collective consciousness."

## Key Discoveries & Architectural Notes

### Template Architecture

**CRITICAL:** The templates for generating the MkDocs site are **NOT** located in standalone `.jinja2` or `.html` files. Instead, they are embedded as multi-line strings within the Python source code.

This is a critical consideration for the 'Forge' persona. All changes to the site's structure, configuration, and layout must be made in these source files:

-   **`src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/scaffolding.py`**: This file contains the Jinja2 template for `mkdocs.yml`. Changes to theme, color palette, navigation, and enabled plugins should be made here.
-   **`src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/adapter.py`**: This file is responsible for generating the individual Markdown pages (like posts and profiles).
-   **`src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/site_generator.py`**: This file orchestrates the overall site generation, including creating aggregate pages like the index and author lists.

To find specific template code, use `grep` to search for distinctive text from the generated output within these Python files.
