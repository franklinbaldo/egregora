# Egregora UX Vision

This document outlines the user experience (UX) vision for blogs generated by Egregora. It is a living document maintained by the Curator persona.

## 1. UX Principles

*(To be developed)*

## 2. Template Architecture

A critical discovery is that Egregora does not use traditional, separate `.jinja2` or `.html` template files. Instead, templates are embedded as strings within the Python source code.

This means that any changes to the site's structure, configuration, or content templates require editing Python files.

The key locations for these embedded templates are:

- **`src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/scaffolding.py`**: This file contains the Jinja2 template for the main `mkdocs.yml` configuration file. All changes to site-wide settings like color palettes, navigation, and plugins must be made here.
- **`src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/adapter.py`**: This file is responsible for generating the individual Markdown pages, such as the blog index and individual posts. The templates for these pages are located here.
- **`src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/site_generator.py`**: This file orchestrates the overall site generation and may contain templates for supplementary pages or data files (e.g., site statistics).

This architecture requires close collaboration between the Curator (design) and Forge (development) personas.
