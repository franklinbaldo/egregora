# 🎭 Curator's UX Vision for Egregora

This document outlines the user experience and user interface (UX/UI) vision for the blogs generated by Egregora. It is a living document, developed and maintained by the Curator persona.

## Core Principles

1.  **Immersive First:** The design must create an immersive, engaging "portal" experience that draws the reader into the collective consciousness. The UI should feel intentional, polished, and distinct.
2.  **Content-First:** The design must prioritize readability and the clear presentation of the generated content. All other design elements are secondary.
3.  **Autonomously Generated, Professionally Presented:** The blog is generated 100% autonomously, but it should not look like it. The final output must be polished, professional, and indistinguishable from a high-quality, human-curated site.
4.  **Privacy-First by Default:** The user's privacy is paramount. Features that could compromise privacy (like analytics) must be opt-in, never on by default.
5.  **Measurable Quality:** All UX decisions should be backed by data where possible. We will use tools like Lighthouse to measure and track our progress on accessibility, performance, and SEO.
6.  **Accessible to All:** The final site must be usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities. We will adhere to WCAG AA standards as a minimum baseline.
7.  **Graceful Degradation:** The site generation process must be resilient. If external dependencies like AI content generation fail, the process should still complete successfully, scaffolding a buildable "empty state" of the site. This allows for inspection and development of the core UX even when content is unavailable.

## Technical & Architectural Discoveries

### Template Architecture

**CRITICAL FINDING:** The templates for the MkDocs site are **not** standalone `.html` or `.jinja2` files. They are embedded as triple-quoted strings within the Python source code OR located in `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/`.

The key locations for these templates are:
-   `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/scaffolding.py`: Logic that copies templates and renders `mkdocs.yml.jinja`.
-   `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/mkdocs.yml.jinja`: The Jinja2 template for the main configuration.
-   `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/assets`: Contains static assets like `favicon.png`.

### Developer Experience
-   **Status:** Fragile.
-   **Issue:** The `egregora demo` command is prone to failure when external AI services (e.g., Google Gemini) are unavailable or rate-limited. This crashes the entire process, often preventing the site scaffolding from completing.
    -   **Next Action:** A task `20260117-1500-ux-make-demo-command-resilient.md` exists to implement error handling that ensures the site skeleton is generated even if content generation fails.

## Design System (V1 - "The Portal")

This section defines the "Portal" design system, which aims to create a dark, immersive, and premium experience.

### Color Palette
-   **Status:** Broken.
-   **Primary:** A deep, thoughtful blue (`#2c3e50`) defined in `extra.css`.
-   **Accent:** A vibrant, energetic yellow (`#f9d423`) defined in `extra.css`.
-   **Conflict:** The generated `mkdocs.yml` incorrectly hardcodes `accent: yellow`, which overrides the custom accent color in `extra.css` and breaks the "Portal" theme.
-   **Next Action:** The task `20260116-1400-ux-implement-portal-vision.md` instructs the `forge` persona to modify the `mkdocs.yml.jinja` template to use `accent: custom`.

### Typography
-   **Status:** Defined.
-   **Fonts:** `Outfit` for headings and `Inter` for body text.
-   **Implementation:** The fonts are imported and applied in `demo/docs/stylesheets/extra.css`.

### Favicon
-   **Status:** Needs Verification.
-   **Issue:** A favicon exists at `demo/docs/assets/images/favicon.png`, but it may be the default MkDocs or a placeholder. We need to ensure a distinct, branded favicon is used.
-   **Next Action:** The task `20260116-1400-ux-implement-portal-vision.md` covers verifying and ensuring the favicon is correct.

### Social Cards
-   **Status:** Broken / Disabled.
-   **Issue:** The `social` plugin is commented out in `mkdocs.yml.jinja`, preventing social card generation. Additionally, previous builds showed 404 errors for social cards.
-   **Next Action:** The task `20260116-1400-ux-implement-portal-vision.md` instructs the `forge` persona to uncomment the plugin and ensure dependencies (`mkdocs-material[imaging]`) are present.

### Navigation
-   **Status:** Implemented, but needs review.
-   **Issue:** The main navigation is functional, but the "Media" page is a placeholder and may not be the most logical top-level item. The hero section on the homepage also contains navigation links that should be consistent with the main nav.
-   **Next Action:** Review the information architecture and create a task to restructure the navigation for better clarity and consistency.

### Analytics
-   **Status:** Removed.
-   **Issue:** Previous versions of the generator included a placeholder for a Google Analytics key. As of the latest inspection, this has been removed from the default `mkdocs.yml` template.
-   **Next Action:** None. This issue is resolved and aligns with our "Privacy-First" principle.
