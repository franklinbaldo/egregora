# 🎭 UX Vision for Egregora Blogs

This document outlines the user experience and design vision for the MkDocs blogs generated by Egregora. It is maintained by the **Curator** persona.

## Core Principles

1.  **Content-First:** The design must prioritize readability and clarity of the generated content. All other elements are secondary.
2.  **Autonomously Generated:** Every UX feature must be populatable by Egregora's autonomous analysis of data. We will **never** propose features that require a human to fill in placeholders.
3.  **Privacy as a Feature:** The user's privacy is paramount. We will avoid intrusive features, analytics, and tracking by default.
4.  **Aesthetic Minimalism:** The design should be clean, professional, and uncluttered, using whitespace and typography to create a sense of calm and focus.
5.  **Collective Identity:** The visual design should subtly evoke the concept of a "collective consciousness" or "emergent group reflection."

## Baseline UX Audit (2024-07-26)

The initial audit of the generated blog scaffold revealed a solid foundation using Material for MkDocs, but several areas require immediate attention to establish a unique and professional identity. The tactical backlog for these items is tracked in `TODO.ux.toml`.

### Key Findings:
- **Generic Theming:** The site uses the default "teal" and "amber" color palette.
- **Missing Assets:** A custom favicon and CSS file are referenced but do not exist.
- **Broken Features:** Social card image generation is failing, and Google Analytics is a non-functional placeholder.
- **Unrefined Content:** The "empty state" of the homepage is functional but lacks a welcoming tone.

## ⚠️ Critical Discovery: Template Architecture

A crucial finding of the initial audit is that the MkDocs templates are **not** stored in separate `.jinja2` or `.html` files. Instead, they are embedded as triple-quoted strings within the Python source code of the MkDocs output adapter.

This has significant implications for the **Forge** persona: to implement UX changes, they must directly edit the Python files responsible for scaffolding and page generation.

### Key Template Locations:

-   **`mkdocs.yml` Generation:**
    -   **File:** `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/scaffolding.py`
    -   **Contains:** The Jinja2 template for the main `mkdocs.yml` configuration file. Changes to the color palette, navigation, and plugins are made here.

-   **Markdown Page Generation:**
    -   **File:** `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/adapter.py`
    -   **Contains:** Logic for generating the content of Markdown pages, including the homepage's "empty state."

-   **Site Scaffolding and File Copying:**
    -   **File:** `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/scaffolding.py`
    -   **Contains:** Logic for creating the demo site directory structure and copying theme override files (like custom CSS or favicons).

This centralized, code-driven approach to templating requires close collaboration between the Curator (defining the vision) and the Forge (implementing it in Python).
