# 🎭 Curator's UX Vision for Egregora

This document outlines the user experience and user interface (UX/UI) vision for the blogs generated by Egregora. It is a living document, developed and maintained by the Curator persona.

## Core Principles

1.  **Immersive First:** The design must create an immersive, engaging "portal" experience that draws the reader into the collective consciousness. The UI should feel intentional, polished, and distinct.
2.  **Content-First:** The design must prioritize readability and the clear presentation of the generated content. All other design elements are secondary.
3.  **Autonomously Generated, Professionally Presented:** The blog is generated 100% autonomously, but it should not look like it. The final output must be polished, professional, and indistinguishable from a high-quality, human-curated site.
4.  **Privacy-First by Default:** The user's privacy is paramount. Features that could compromise privacy (like analytics) must be opt-in, never on by default.
5.  **Measurable Quality:** All UX decisions should be backed by data where possible. We will use tools like Lighthouse to measure and track our progress on accessibility, performance, and SEO.
6.  **Accessible to All:** The final site must be usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities. We will adhere to WCAG AA standards as a minimum baseline.
7.  **Graceful Degradation:** The site generation process must be resilient. If external dependencies like AI content generation fail, the process should still complete successfully, scaffolding a buildable "empty state" of the site. This allows for inspection and development of the core UX even when content is unavailable.

## Technical & Architectural Discoveries

### Template Architecture

<<<<<<< HEAD
**CRITICAL FINDING:** The templates for the MkDocs site have been moved to Jinja2 files in `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/`.
=======
**CRITICAL FINDING:** The templates for the MkDocs site have been moved to Jinja2 files in `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/`. This is a significant improvement over the previous embedded string approach.
>>>>>>> origin/pr/2729

Key locations:
-   `src/egregora/output_sinks/mkdocs/scaffolding.py`: Renders these templates during the scaffold process.
-   `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/mkdocs.yml.jinja`: The main configuration template.
<<<<<<< HEAD
-   `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/overrides/stylesheets/extra.css`: The structural CSS (layout, navigation) AND the "Portal" theme styles (Consolidated).
-   `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/docs/stylesheets/extra.css`: REMOVED (Fixed shadowing issue).
=======
-   `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/docs/stylesheets/extra.css`: The "Portal" theme styles.
>>>>>>> origin/pr/2729

### Developer Experience
-   **Status:** Improving.
-   **Issue:** The `egregora demo` command works but throws a `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` at the end. It successfully generates the site structure even if API keys are missing (Graceful Degradation working!).
-   **Next Action:** A task should be created to fix the event loop error, but it is not blocking UX work.

## Design System (V1 - "The Portal")

This section defines the "Portal" design system, which aims to create a dark, immersive, and premium experience.

### CSS Architecture
<<<<<<< HEAD
-   **Status:** Fixed.
-   **Resolution:** The fragmented CSS has been consolidated. `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/docs/stylesheets/extra.css` was removed, and its styles merged into `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/overrides/stylesheets/extra.css`. This resolved the shadowing issue, restoring the correct styling for the homepage navigation and blog cards.
=======
-   **Status:** Verified.
-   **Issue:** The CSS was previously split, causing shadowing issues. This has been resolved by consolidating all styles into `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/overrides/stylesheets/extra.css`.
>>>>>>> origin/pr/2881
-   **Next Action:** None.

### Color Palette
<<<<<<< HEAD
-   **Status:** Verified.
=======
-   **Status:** Implemented.
>>>>>>> origin/pr/2729
-   **Primary:** A deep, thoughtful blue (`#2c3e50`) defined in `extra.css`.
-   **Accent:** A vibrant, energetic yellow (`#f9d423`) defined in `extra.css`.
-   **Implementation:** `mkdocs.yml` uses `primary: custom` and `accent: custom`.

### Scoping and Usability
<<<<<<< HEAD
-   **Status:** Verified.
-   **Issue:** Previous aggressive global CSS overrides have been successfully scoped. The homepage now uses `:has(.homepage-hero)` to apply immersive styles only where appropriate.
-   **Next Action:** None.
=======
-   **Status:** Needs Refinement.
-   **Issue:** The "Portal" theme uses aggressive global CSS overrides in `extra.css` (e.g., hiding TOC and H1 globally). This degrades usability on standard content pages.
-   **Next Action:** Task `20260122-1400-ux-refine-portal-theme-scoping.md` has been created to scope these overrides to the homepage only using frontmatter and removing global CSS blocks.
>>>>>>> origin/pr/2729

### Typography
-   **Status:** Verified.
-   **Fonts:** `Outfit` for headings and `Inter` for body text.
-   **Implementation:** The fonts are imported and applied in `extra.css`.

### Navigation
<<<<<<< HEAD
-   **Status:** Verified.
-   **Issue:** The navigation hierarchy is correct (Media nested under Resources). The homepage "Quick Navigation" cards are now correctly styled following the CSS consolidation.
-   **Next Action:** None.

### Feeds Page
-   **Status:** Verified.
<<<<<<< HEAD
-   **Resolution:** A dedicated `docs/feeds/index.md` page exists, providing a clean UI for subscribing to RSS and JSON feeds.
=======
-   **Issue:** The "RSS Feeds" card now links to a dedicated feeds page. The template `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/docs/feeds/index.md.jinja` has been implemented.
>>>>>>> origin/pr/2881
-   **Next Action:** None.
=======
-   **Status:** Implemented, but needs review.
-   **Issue:** The main navigation is functional. "Media" is top-level.
-   **Next Action:** Review if "Media" should be nested under "Resources" or similar. Task `20260122-1400-ux-refine-portal-theme-scoping.md` addresses this potential restructure.
>>>>>>> origin/pr/2729

### Analytics
-   **Status:** Verified (Removed).
-   **Issue:** Analytics placeholders have been removed from the default configuration.
-   **Next Action:** None.
