# Egregora MkDocs UX/UI Vision

Last updated: 2024-07-25
Demo version: (TBD after first generation)

## Vision Statement

Egregora-generated MkDocs blogs should be the most beautiful, readable,
and delightful documentation in the privacy-first AI space. Users should
feel confident, informed, and respected.

## Design Principles

- **Readability First:** Optimize for long-form reading. Content is king.
- **Autonomous by Default:** Every feature must be populatable by Egregora from data alone. No human placeholders.
- **Privacy-Conscious Aesthetics:** Visuals should evoke trust, transparency, and professionalism.
- **Data-Driven:** Decisions are based on UX principles and metrics (Lighthouse, WCAG), not subjective preference.

## Architecture & Templates

This vision is implemented through the MkDocs Material theme. Customizations and overrides are located in the source templates, which are then used by the `egregora demo` command to generate the site.

- **Template Location:** `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site`
