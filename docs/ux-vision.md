# 🎭 UX Vision for Egregora-Generated Blogs

This document outlines the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) vision for the MkDocs blogs generated by Egregora. It is a living document maintained by the "Curator" 🎭 persona.

## Core Principles

1.  **100% Autonomously Generated**: Every aspect of the UX and UI must be achievable through Egregora's autonomous data analysis. We will **never** propose features that require human input, placeholders, or manual configuration to complete. The design emerges from the data.

2.  **Content is the Hero**: The primary goal of the design is to present the generated content in the most readable, engaging, and accessible way possible. The UI should be a clean, unobtrusive vessel for the ideas within the content.

3.  **Reflect the "Collective Consciousness"**: The aesthetic should evoke the theme of an "emergent group reflection engine." This translates to a design that feels cohesive, intelligent, and interconnected, rather than a generic template.

4.  **Excellence in Fundamentals**: We will adhere to the highest standards of web development fundamentals. This includes:
    *   **Performance**: Sub-second load times.
    *   **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance as a minimum.
    *   **Responsiveness**: A flawless experience on any device, from a small phone to a large monitor.

## ⚠️ Critical: Template Architecture

A critical discovery is that the templates for the MkDocs site are **not** stored as `.jinja2` or `.html` files in a traditional `templates` directory.

Instead, they are embedded as triple-quoted strings within the Python source code of the MkDocs output adapter. The Forge persona must edit these Python files to implement UX changes.

**Key Source Files:**
-   **`src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/scaffolding.py`**: Generates `mkdocs.yml` and the initial site structure. This is where configuration-level UX decisions (like color palettes, navigation, and enabled features) are made.
-   **`src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/adapter.py`**: Generates the individual Markdown pages (posts, profiles, etc.).
-   **`src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/site_generator.py`**: Orchestrates the overall site generation and provides data to the templates.

## Design System (Evolving)

This section will evolve over time to define the specific components and styles of our design system.

### Color Palette
*   **Status**: Undefined.
*   **Vision**: To be designed by the Curator. The palette will move away from the generic Material for MkDocs defaults (Teal/Amber) and will be inspired by the "collective consciousness" theme. It will be a professional, high-contrast, and accessible palette.

### Typography
*   **Status**: Default (Roboto / Roboto Mono).
*   **Vision**: We will establish a clear and consistent typography scale. We will select fonts that are highly readable and that complement the brand identity.

### Spacing & Layout
*   **Status**: Default.
*   **Vision**: A consistent spacing system (e.g., an 8px grid) will be implemented to ensure a harmonious and professional layout.

## Feature Roadmap

This is a high-level overview of the UX features we aim to implement. For a tactical, up-to-date task list, see `TODO.ux.toml`.

1.  **Baseline Polish**: Address the foundational issues like missing CSS, favicons, and broken social card images.
2.  **Brand Identity**: Implement a custom color palette, typography, and site name strategy.
3.  **Improved Content Experience**: Enhance readability, add features like "Related Posts" and breadcrumbs, and improve the empty states.
4.  **Navigation Refinement**: Create a more intuitive information architecture.
5.  **Accessibility Audit**: Systematically review and improve the site to meet WCAG AA standards.
