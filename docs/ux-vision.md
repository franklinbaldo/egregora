# 🎭 Curator's UX Vision for Egregora

This document outlines the user experience and user interface (UX/UI) vision for the blogs generated by Egregora. It is a living document, developed and maintained by the Curator persona.

## Core Principles

1.  **Immersive First:** The design must create an immersive, engaging "portal" experience that draws the reader into the collective consciousness. The UI should feel intentional, polished, and distinct.
2.  **Content-First:** The design must prioritize readability and the clear presentation of the generated content. All other design elements are secondary.
3.  **Autonomously Generated, Professionally Presented:** The blog is generated 100% autonomously, but it should not look like it. The final output must be polished, professional, and indistinguishable from a high-quality, human-curated site.
4.  **Privacy-First by Default:** The user's privacy is paramount. Features that could compromise privacy (like analytics) must be opt-in, never on by default.
5.  **Measurable Quality:** All UX decisions should be backed by data where possible. We will use tools like Lighthouse to measure and track our progress on accessibility, performance, and SEO.
6.  **Accessible to All:** The final site must be usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities. We will adhere to WCAG AA standards as a minimum baseline.

## Technical & Architectural Discoveries

### Template Architecture

**CRITICAL FINDING:** The templates for the MkDocs site are **not** standalone `.html` or `.jinja2` files. They are embedded as triple-quoted strings within the Python source code.

This has significant implications for how we work:
-   **Forge Persona:** All UX/UI changes will require modifying Python files, not just HTML/CSS.
-   **Curator Persona:** My tasks must be extremely precise, pointing to the exact Python file and even the specific function or variable that contains the template string.

The key locations for these embedded templates are:
-   `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/scaffolding.py`: Generates `mkdocs.yml` and the core site structure.
-   `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/adapter.py`: Generates the individual Markdown pages for posts, profiles, etc.
-   `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/site_generator.py`: Orchestrates the assembly of the site and generation of summary pages.

### Developer Experience
-   **Status:** Broken.
-   **Issue:** The `egregora demo` and `mkdocs build` commands fail due to numerous missing dependencies in `pyproject.toml`. This makes the project unusable in a clean environment.
-   **Next Action:** A comprehensive task, `20260116-1400-ux-implement-portal-vision.md`, has been created for the `forge` persona to add all required dependencies to `pyproject.toml`.

## Design System (V1 - "The Portal")

This section defines the "Portal" design system, which aims to create a dark, immersive, and premium experience.

### Color Palette
-   **Status:** Broken.
-   **Primary:** A deep, thoughtful blue (`#2c3e50`) defined in `extra.css`.
-   **Accent:** A vibrant, energetic yellow (`#f9d423`) defined in `extra.css`.
-   **Conflict:** The generated `mkdocs.yml` incorrectly hardcodes `accent: yellow`, which overrides the custom accent color in `extra.css` and breaks the "Portal" theme.
-   **Next Action:** The task `20260116-1400-ux-implement-portal-vision.md` instructs the `forge` persona to modify the `mkdocs.yml` template to use `accent: custom`.

### Typography
-   **Status:** Defined.
-   **Fonts:** `Outfit` for headings and `Inter` for body text.
-   **Implementation:** The fonts are imported and applied in `demo/docs/stylesheets/extra.css`.

### Favicon
-   **Status:** Missing.
-   **Issue:** The site is missing a favicon, which is referenced in the generated `mkdocs.yml` but not included in the scaffolded files.
-   **Next Action:** The task `20260116-1400-ux-implement-portal-vision.md` instructs the `forge` persona to add a placeholder favicon and ensure it's copied during the scaffolding process.

### Social Cards
-   **Status:** Broken.
-   **Issue:** The social card generation fails with 404 errors during the `mkdocs build` process.
-   **Next Action:** The task `20260116-1400-ux-implement-portal-vision.md` instructs the `forge` persona to fix the social card generation.

### Navigation
-   **Status:** Implemented, but needs review.
-   **Issue:** The main navigation is functional, but the "Media" page is a placeholder and may not be the most logical top-level item. The hero section on the homepage also contains navigation links that should be consistent with the main nav.
-   **Next Action:** Review the information architecture and create a task to restructure the navigation for better clarity and consistency.

### Analytics
-   **Status:** Removed.
-   **Issue:** Previous versions of the generator included a placeholder for a Google Analytics key. As of the latest inspection, this has been removed from the default `mkdocs.yml` template.
-   **Next Action:** None. This issue is resolved and aligns with our "Privacy-First" principle.
