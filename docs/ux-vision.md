# 🎭 Curator's UX Vision for Egregora

This document outlines the user experience and user interface (UX/UI) vision for the blogs generated by Egregora. It is a living document, developed and maintained by the Curator persona.

## Core Principles

1.  **Immersive First:** The design must create an immersive, engaging "portal" experience that draws the reader into the collective consciousness. The UI should feel intentional, polished, and distinct.
2.  **Content-First:** The design must prioritize readability and the clear presentation of the generated content. All other design elements are secondary.
3.  **Autonomously Generated, Professionally Presented:** The blog is generated 100% autonomously, but it should not look like it. The final output must be polished, professional, and indistinguishable from a high-quality, human-curated site.
4.  **Privacy-First by Default:** The user's privacy is paramount. Features that could compromise privacy (like analytics) must be opt-in, never on by default.
5.  **Measurable Quality:** All UX decisions should be backed by data where possible. We will use tools like Lighthouse to measure and track our progress on accessibility, performance, and SEO.
6.  **Accessible to All:** The final site must be usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities. We will adhere to WCAG AA standards as a minimum baseline.
7.  **Graceful Degradation:** The site generation process must be resilient. If external dependencies like AI content generation fail, the process should still complete successfully, scaffolding a buildable "empty state" of the site. This allows for inspection and development of the core UX even when content is unavailable.

## Technical & Architectural Discoveries

### Template Architecture

**CRITICAL FINDING:** The templates for the MkDocs site are **not** standalone `.html` or `.jinja2` files. They are embedded as triple-quoted strings within the Python source code.

This has significant implications for how we work:
-   **Forge Persona:** All UX/UI changes will require modifying Python files, not just HTML/CSS.
-   **Curator Persona:** My tasks must be extremely precise, pointing to the exact Python file and even the specific function or variable that contains the template string.

The key locations for these embedded templates are:
-   `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/scaffolding.py`: Generates `mkdocs.yml` and the core site structure.
-   `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/adapter.py`: Generates the individual Markdown pages for posts, profiles, etc.
-   `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/site_generator.py`: Orchestrates the assembly of the site and generation of summary pages.

### Developer Experience
-   **Status:** Improved.
-   **Issue:** The `egregora demo` command was failing when API keys were missing or rate-limited.
-   **Resolution:** The command now gracefully handles API failures by falling back to generating an offline "empty state" site, ensuring development can continue. The `egregora demo` command is now resilient.

## Design System (V1 - "The Portal")

This section defines the "Portal" design system, which aims to create a dark, immersive, and premium experience.

### Color Palette
-   **Status:** Fixed.
-   **Primary:** A deep, thoughtful blue (`#2c3e50`) defined in `extra.css`.
-   **Accent:** A vibrant, energetic yellow (`#f9d423`) defined in `extra.css`.
-   **Resolution:** The generated `mkdocs.yml` template has been updated to use `accent: custom`, allowing `extra.css` to correctly control the palette.

### Typography
-   **Status:** Defined.
-   **Fonts:** `Outfit` for headings and `Inter` for body text.
-   **Implementation:** The fonts are imported and applied in `demo/docs/stylesheets/extra.css`.

### Favicon
-   **Status:** Implemented.
-   **Resolution:** A placeholder favicon has been added to the project and the scaffolding process ensures it is correctly copied to the site.

### Social Cards
-   **Status:** Fixed.
-   **Resolution:** The `social` plugin has been enabled in the `mkdocs.yml` template, allowing social cards to be generated correctly during the build.

### Navigation
-   **Status:** Implemented, but needs review.
-   **Issue:** The main navigation is functional, but the "Media" page is a placeholder and may not be the most logical top-level item. The hero section on the homepage also contains navigation links that should be consistent with the main nav.
-   **Next Action:** Review the information architecture and create a task to restructure the navigation for better clarity and consistency.

### Analytics
-   **Status:** Removed.
-   **Issue:** Previous versions of the generator included a placeholder for a Google Analytics key. As of the latest inspection, this has been removed from the default `mkdocs.yml` template.
-   **Next Action:** None. This issue is resolved and aligns with our "Privacy-First" principle.
