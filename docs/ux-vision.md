# 🎭 Curator's UX Vision for Egregora Blogs

This document outlines the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) vision for blogs generated by Egregora. It is a living document, developed and maintained by the "Curator" 🎭 persona. The goal is to ensure every generated blog is not just functional, but excellent: readable, accessible, and professional.

## Core Principles

1.  **Readability First:** The primary goal is to create a comfortable and focused reading experience. This means optimal line length, generous whitespace, high contrast, and a clear typographic hierarchy.
2.  **Autonomous & Data-Driven:** All UI/UX features must be generatable from the source data without human intervention. We will never require a user to fill in placeholders.
3.  **Accessibility by Default:** We will adhere to WCAG AA standards as a minimum, with AAA as a stretch goal. This is non-negotiable.
4.  **Performant & Lightweight:** The generated sites will be static HTML with minimal JavaScript, ensuring fast load times and a low resource footprint.
5.  **Professional Polish:** While generated, the sites should not feel generic. We will strive for a level of polish that inspires confidence and pride.

## Technical Discoveries

This section documents key architectural findings that are critical for implementing the UX vision.

### MkDocs Template Architecture

*   **Location:** The core MkDocs templates are located in `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/`.
*   **Mechanism:** Egregora generates a new MkDocs site into the `demo/` (or user-specified output) directory by copying and rendering these templates.
*   **Critical Insight:** To make persistent UX/UI changes, modifications **must** be made to the templates in `src/`. Editing the generated output in `demo/` is futile, as changes will be overwritten on the next run.
