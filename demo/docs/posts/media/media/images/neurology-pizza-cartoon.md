# neurology-pizza-cartoon

![Cartoon of three neurologists in a canteen. One states the pizza looks exactly like the brain scan of someone experiencing apophenia.](IMG-20251027-WA0023.jpg)

## Description
A humorous single-panel cartoon set in the 'Neurology Department Canteen,' showing three doctors examining a pizza. One doctor comments that the pizza looks exactly like the brain scan of someone experiencing apophenia. The joke relies on the visual similarity between the topping patterns and medical imagery.
