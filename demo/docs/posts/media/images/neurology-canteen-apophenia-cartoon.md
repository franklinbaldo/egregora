![Cartoon of three doctors in a neurology canteen; one points at a pizza and compares it to a brain scan of someone with apophenia.](IMG-20251027-WA0023.jpg)

## Description
A humorous cartoon set in a neurology department canteen where three doctors are having lunch. One doctor points to a pizza and remarks that it looks exactly like a brain scan of someone experiencing apophenia, which is the tendency to see patterns in random data.
