Because this table is wide and sparse, columns like `title` (required for Posts) or `filename` (required for Media) were nullable to accommodate other types. This allowed invalid states, such as a Post without a title.\n\n## Action\nI implemented conditional `CHECK` constraints to enforce type-specific requirements at the database level:\n- **Posts**: Must have `title`, `slug`, and valid `status`.\n- **Profiles**: Must have `title` and `subject_uuid`.\n- **Journals**: Must have `title`, `window_start`, and `window_end`.\n- **Media**: Must have `filename`.\n\nThe constraints use the pattern: `CHECK ((doc_type != \'type\') OR (requirements))`.\n\nI also:\n1.  Created `docs/schema-evolution-plan.md` to document the strategy.\n2.  Updated `src/egregora/database/schemas.py` to define these constraints.\n3.  Updated `src/egregora/database/init.py` to apply them during initialization.\n4.  Refactored `src/egregora/database/migrations.py` to support migrating existing tables to the new schema with constraints, using a ""create-copy-swap"" strategy.\n5.  Added comprehensive tests in `tests/unit/database/test_unified_schema_constraints.py`.\n\n## Reflection\nThis change aligns the `documents` table with the ""Structure Before Scale"" philosophy. By enforcing these rules in DuckDB, we prevent data corruption bugs from propagating. The migration strategy is robust and idempotent. Future work should verify if `ContentRepository` needs updates to fully utilize the `documents` table, as there seemed to be some disconnects between the repository and the initialization logic.', 'password': '***'}"

The generated site used the default material theme colors (teal/amber) instead of the specified custom colors (#2c3e50/#f9d423). The social cards feature was broken due to missing configuration, and the site lacked a favicon.\n\n**Action:**\n1.  **Updated Template:** Modified `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/mkdocs.yml.jinja` to set `accent: custom` and enable the `social` plugin.\n2.  **Added Favicon:** Created a placeholder favicon at `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/assets/images/favicon.png`.\n3.  **Verified:** Validated the fixes by regenerating the demo site and inspecting the output. Used Playwright to verify the favicon and social card metadata presence.\n\n**Reflection:** The `egregora demo` command is idempotent regarding `mkdocs.yml`; it doesn't overwrite it if it exists. This made verification slightly tricky (had to delete `demo` folder). Future improvements could include a force-regenerate option. The UX is now much closer to the vision, with the dark theme properly applied."", 'password': '***'}"

It allowed potentially ambiguous connection strings and lacked a centralized validation mechanism, violating the 'One good path over many' and 'Explicit over implicit' heuristics.\n\n**Action:**\nI refactored the '_create_database_backend' function to use a new, extracted helper '_validate_and_connect'. This helper strictly enforces that database settings are provided as valid Ibis-compatible URIs (e.g., 'duckdb:///path.db'), explicitly rejecting raw filesystem paths that could be misinterpreted. This change was verified with a new test suite 'tests/unit/orchestration/pipelines/test_write_db_creation.py'.\n\n**Reflection:**\nBy enforcing strict URI schemas, we reduce the cognitive load on operators and prevent subtle configuration errors. The extraction of '_validate_and_connect' also makes the validation logic reusable and independently testable, aligning with 'Small modules over clever modules'.\n"", 'password': '***'}"

I found that `Curator` and `Visionary` have significant dependencies on `Forge`, `Builder`, and `Architect`, none of whom were active or had submitted plans for this sprint. `Steward`\'s plan had merge conflicts which I resolved.\n\n**Action:** I consolidated the plans into `SPRINT_STATE.md` for Sprint 3. I explicitly deferred the blocked tasks (Curator\'s implementation work, Visionary\'s prototyping) to prevent sprint failure. I prioritized the self-contained work of `Sentinel`, `Refactor`, and `Artisan`. I also voted for `Forge`, `Builder`, and `Architect` to ensure they are available for the next cycle.\n\n**Reflection:** The team\'s ambition is outpacing its implementation capacity. We have good strategy and design (Visionary, Curator) but are bottling up on execution (Forge, Builder). Future scheduling must ensure that ""Thinkers"" are paired with ""Doers"" in the same sprint to maintain flow.', 'password': '***'}"
