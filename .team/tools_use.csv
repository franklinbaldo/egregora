Because this table is wide and sparse, columns like `title` (required for Posts) or `filename` (required for Media) were nullable to accommodate other types. This allowed invalid states, such as a Post without a title.\n\n## Action\nI implemented conditional `CHECK` constraints to enforce type-specific requirements at the database level:\n- **Posts**: Must have `title`, `slug`, and valid `status`.\n- **Profiles**: Must have `title` and `subject_uuid`.\n- **Journals**: Must have `title`, `window_start`, and `window_end`.\n- **Media**: Must have `filename`.\n\nThe constraints use the pattern: `CHECK ((doc_type != \'type\') OR (requirements))`.\n\nI also:\n1.  Created `docs/schema-evolution-plan.md` to document the strategy.\n2.  Updated `src/egregora/database/schemas.py` to define these constraints.\n3.  Updated `src/egregora/database/init.py` to apply them during initialization.\n4.  Refactored `src/egregora/database/migrations.py` to support migrating existing tables to the new schema with constraints, using a ""create-copy-swap"" strategy.\n5.  Added comprehensive tests in `tests/unit/database/test_unified_schema_constraints.py`.\n\n## Reflection\nThis change aligns the `documents` table with the ""Structure Before Scale"" philosophy. By enforcing these rules in DuckDB, we prevent data corruption bugs from propagating. The migration strategy is robust and idempotent. Future work should verify if `ContentRepository` needs updates to fully utilize the `documents` table, as there seemed to be some disconnects between the repository and the initialization logic.', 'password': '***'}"

The documented command `uv tool run --with "".[mkdocs]"" ...` relied on the presence of a local `pyproject.toml`, which end-users typically do not have. This led to a confusing experience where users could initialize a site but not preview it.\n\n**Action:**\n1.  Verified the failure by simulating a user environment (outside the repo root).\n2.  Explored alternative commands and discovered that `uv tool run --from ""git+https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora[mkdocs]"" mkdocs serve ...` is the most robust solution. It ensures version consistency and correctly installs the necessary plugins without requiring a local source checkout.\n3.  Updated `README.md` to use this new, reliable command.\n4.  Verified that the `egregora demo` command works (and even suggests the long-form command, which I\'ve now simplified in the docs).\n\n**Reflection:** The documentation now accurately reflects the user\'s reality. By fixing this critical step in the ""Getting Started"" guide, we ensure that new users can successfully reach the ""Aha!"" moment of seeing their blog. For future sessions, I should consider documenting the `egregora demo` command as a first-class feature, as it provides an excellent quick-start experience. I also noted that the `egregora demo` output suggests a very verbose command; a future task could be to update that output to match the cleaner command I just documented.\n', 'password': '***'}"
