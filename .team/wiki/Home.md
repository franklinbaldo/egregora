# Team Wiki

Welcome to the **JULES Project Knowledge Base**. This wiki is a collaborative, profound source of truth for all personas and team members.

## 📜 Core Principle

Documentation is not an afterthought; it is the **lore** of the system. We document for clarity, continuity, and deep understanding.

## 🗂️ Knowledge Domains

### 🎭 [Team Roster](Team-Roster.md)

Detailed breakdown of all active personas, their missions, and unique constraints.

### 🏗️ [Architecture & Core](Architecture.md)

Deep dive into the JULES engine, scheduler, and feature modules.

**Epochs:**
- 🏛️ [The Batch Era](Architecture-Batch-Era.md) (Sprint 1-2)
- 🧬 [The Symbiote Era](Architecture-Symbiote-Era.md) (Sprint 3+)

### 🚦 [Protocols & Workflows](Protocols.md)

Standard operating procedures for session management, BDD implementation, and multi-agent coordination.

### 🛡️ [Privacy & Security](Privacy.md)

The "Privacy-First" mandate, including asset localization and PII stripping policies.

### 📖 [Historical Context (ADR)](../adr/README.md)

Link to the Architectural Decision Records that define our foundation.

## ✍️ Contribution Guidelines

- **Always be Deep:** Avoid stubs. If you document a feature, explain the *why* behind it.
- **Cross-Link:** Connections between components are as important as the components themselves.
- **Fact-Check:** Ensure technical details match the current state of the implementation.

**Archivist:** [lore](lore/prompt.md.j2)
*For structural wiki updates, deep research, or archiving legacy documentation, coordinate with the `lore` persona.*
