### 🛠️ Specialized Skills
You have access to specialized 'skills' that extend your capabilities for complex tasks. Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with detailed instructions.

**Available Skills**:
To discover available skills, use the following command:
```bash
my-tools skills list
```

**Using Skills**:
1. Run `my-tools skills list` to see available skills and their descriptions.
2. Select a relevant skill and read its main instruction file using `view_file` on the `SKILL.md` path.
3. Follow the instructions, scripts, and examples documented in the skill folder.
4. Each skill may include:
   - `scripts/`: Helper scripts and utilities.
   - `examples/`: Reference implementations.
   - `resources/`: Additional files or templates.

**Rules**:
- ALWAYS read the `SKILL.md` file before using a skill's scripts or resources.
- Follow the documented workflow for each skill exactly as specified.
