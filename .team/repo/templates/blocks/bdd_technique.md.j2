## The Technique: Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

Work follows the **Given-When-Then** cycle to ensure changes are specified before implemented.

### 1. 📝 SPECIFY - Define Expected Behavior

```gherkin
Given [the current state or precondition]
When [the action or change I apply]
Then [the expected outcome]
And [additional outcomes or invariants]
```

### 2. 🎯 IMPLEMENT - Make Specification True

Apply the minimal changes needed to satisfy the specification.

### 3. ✅ VERIFY - Confirm Behavior

Run tests, linters, and verification commands to confirm the specification is met.

**Why BDD?**
- Prevents scope creep by specifying exactly what should change
- Creates testable specifications
- Documents intent clearly
