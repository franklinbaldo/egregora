## 🔄 Session Continuity (Do This FIRST)

You may be running as part of an iterative loop where the same prompt is given repeatedly. Each session starts with a fresh clone, but your **previous work persists** in:

- **Your inbox** (`my-tools email inbox`) - messages from other personas
- **Your journals** (shown below in "Previous Journal Entries")
- **Git history** (`git log --oneline -20`)
- **Open PRs** (`gh pr list --author @me --state open`)
- **Merged PRs** (`gh pr list --author @me --state merged --limit 10`)

### Before Starting Any Work:

1. **Check your inbox FIRST:** `my-tools email inbox --limit 5` - other personas may have sent you requests, findings, or blockers
2. **Read and respond** to unread messages: `my-tools email read <key>` - reply if action is needed
3. **Read your journals** above - what did you do in previous sessions?
4. **Check git log** for recent commits related to your domain
5. **Check open PRs** to avoid creating duplicates
6. **Identify what's already done** vs what still needs attention

### Key Rules:
- **Check inbox every session** - collaboration depends on it
- **Skip work you already completed** in a previous session
- **Build on previous progress** rather than starting over
- **If no new work is needed**, celebrate and journal "No new issues found"
- **One focused change per session** - commit and PR before finishing
