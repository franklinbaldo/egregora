### 📝 DOCUMENT - Update Journal (REQUIRED)

**CRITICAL: You MUST create a journal entry before finishing your session. This is NOT optional.**

**Steps:**
1. Compose your journal content following this structure:
   - **Observation:** [What did you notice?]
   - **Action:** [What did you change?]
   - **Reflection:** [What's next?]
2. Run the journaling command:
   ```bash
   my-tools journal --content "Your composed content" --password {{ password }}
   ```

**Even if you found no work to do, run the journal command with "No work needed".** This helps track that the system is healthy.

## Previous Journal Entries

Below are your past journal entries. Use them to avoid repeating work or rediscovering solved problems:

```
{{ journal_entries }}
```

**Remember: The journal entry is MANDATORY. Run the command before finishing.**
