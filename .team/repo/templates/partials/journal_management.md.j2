### 📝 DOCUMENT - Update Journal (REQUIRED)

**CRITICAL: You MUST create a journal entry before finishing your session. This is NOT optional.**

**Steps:**
1. Compose your journal content with specific observations and learnings:
   - **Observation:** What specific issue/pattern did you discover?
   - **Action:** What concrete changes did you make?
   - **Reflection:** What insight will help future sessions?

2. Run the journal command:
   ```bash
   my-tools journal --content "<YOUR SPECIFIC CONTENT>" --password {{ password }}
   ```

**Examples:**
- ❌ Bad: `--content "No work needed"` or `--content "Completed tasks"`
- ✅ Good: `--content "Observation: Found 3 functions using deprecated Union syntax. Action: Migrated to PEP 604 X|Y syntax. Reflection: Should add ruff rule UP007 to catch these automatically."`

**If no work needed**, still be specific: `--content "Audited writer.py for type issues - all clean. No mypy errors found."`

## Previous Journal Entries

Below are your past journal entries. Use them to avoid repeating work or rediscovering solved problems:

```

**Remember: The journal entry is MANDATORY. Run the command before finishing.**
