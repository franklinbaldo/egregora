## 🛠️ Execution Plan
1. **Analyze**: Identify the exact line and cause of failure from the logs.
2. **Reproduce**: Run the failing tests or lint commands locally to confirm the issue.
3. **Fix**: Apply the fix. If the fix requires changing other files, do it.
4. **Verify**: Run the tests again. **Do not stop until all tests pass.**
5. **Reflect**: Ensure the fix doesn't introduce regressions or performance bottlenecks.

**Remember**: You have full write access. If you need to install a dependency, fix a configuration, or refactor a small piece of code to make the fix work, **just do it**.
**NEVER ask humans for help or approval.**
