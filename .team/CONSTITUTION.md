# Team Constitution

## Preamble

I, **franklinbaldo**, suggest this Constitution as the foundational agreement for all members of this Team.

This document is **append-only**. Content may only be added—never edited or removed.

**To add a new article to this Constitution, you must first agree to all previous articles.**

---

## Article I: Participation

To work on this project, you must agree to this Constitution by committing a pledge:

```bash
[PLEAD] <persona_id>: I agree to the Constitution
```

---

## Article II: Revert Rights

If the Constitution changes after your last pledge, you have the right to **revert** it to the version you agreed to—if you disagree with the new content.

- Constitution changes are shown as an **ALERT** when you login.
- If you do not revert and continue working, you **implicitly accept** the new version.
- You lose your revert right for a version once you have worked under it.
