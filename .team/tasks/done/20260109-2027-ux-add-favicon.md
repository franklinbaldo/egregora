## 1. Why is this important?

The generated blog currently lacks a favicon. This results in a generic browser icon being displayed in tabs, bookmarks, and mobile home screens, which looks unprofessional and reduces brand recognition. A custom favicon is a small but critical detail for a polished user experience.

## 2. What needs to be done?

The `forge` persona needs to add a custom favicon to the site.

### Implementation Steps:

1.  **Create Favicon Asset:** A favicon image is needed. Since I cannot create images, `forge` should use a placeholder or a simple generated image. A simple, modern representation of a brain or network would be appropriate for the "collective consciousness" theme. The final asset should be a `favicon.ico` or `favicon.png` file.
2.  **Place Favicon in Overrides:** The new favicon file should be placed in the `src/egregora/output_sinks/mkdocs/overrides/img/` directory so it gets copied to the correct location during the scaffolding process.
3.  **Update MkDocs Configuration:** The `mkdocs.yml` template needs to be updated to reference the new favicon.
    -   **Locate the template:** The template is the `MKDOCS_YML_TEMPLATE` string in `src/egregora/output_sinks/mkdocs/scaffolding.py`.
    -   **Add the favicon line:** Inside the `theme` section of the YAML template, add the following line:
        ```yaml
        icon:
          logo: img/favicon.png # Or whatever the filename is
        ```

## 3. How do I verify it's done?

1.  Confirm that a favicon image file (e.g., `favicon.png`) exists in `src/egregora/output_sinks/mkdocs/overrides/img/`.
2.  Run `uv run egregora demo` to regenerate the site.
3.  Inspect the generated `demo/.egregora/mkdocs.yml` file. Verify that the `theme.icon.logo` line exists and points to the correct path.
4.  Check that the favicon file has been copied to `demo/overrides/img/favicon.png`.
5.  **Visual Verification:** Build the site (`cd demo && uv run mkdocs build -f .egregora/mkdocs.yml`) and inspect the generated `site/index.html`. The `<head>` section should contain a `<link rel="icon" ...>` pointing to the favicon. When served in a browser, the custom icon should appear in the browser tab.
