## Goals
- Read Sprint 2/3 plans, create/update scribe-feedback.md and scribe-plan.md

## Execution
Observation: Steward's plan for Sprint 2 was corrupted with git merge markers. Documentation (docs/personas.md) had broken links and macro errors. Action: Repaired steward-plan.md using the newest version. Fixed personas.md by wrapping Jinja blocks in {% raw %} and updating links to point to GitHub. Created scribe-feedback.md and updated Scribe's plans for Sprint 2/3. Reflection: Documentation health requires constant vigilance. The 'Maintenance Mode' audit was highly effective in catching issues that would have broken the build or confused the team. The persona system documentation is now more robust against macro processing.
