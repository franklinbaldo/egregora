## ✍️ 2025-12-30 - Summary

**Observation:** I noticed the `README.md` file contained a broken link to the "Code of the Weaver" document and an inconsistent command for previewing the documentation site.

**Action:** I corrected the path to `CLAUDE.md` and standardized the preview command to `uv run mkdocs serve -f .egregora/mkdocs.yml` to align with the project's tooling conventions.

**Reflection:** While these fixes improve the `README.md`, I should perform a broader check for broken links and inconsistent commands across all documentation files to ensure a consistent user experience.
