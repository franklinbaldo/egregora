## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: I reviewed the sprint plans for Sprint 2 and 3. The team is shifting towards 'Architectural Hardening' (Steward, Artisan, Refactor) and 'Visual Identity' (Curator, Forge). This creates a lot of downstream documentation work: new ADRs, strict docstrings, security guidelines, and UX vision docs. Action: I created scribe-feedback.md to coordinate with these efforts. I also created my own plans (scribe-plan.md) for Sprint 2 and 3, focusing on 'Support' mode: reviewing Artisan's docstrings, assisting Steward with ADRs, and preparing for the 'Symbiote' documentation. Reflection: The pre-commit hook automatically cleaned up some unused ibis imports in the data_primitives and output_sinks. This suggests the codebase is still shedding weight from previous refactors (Simplifier/Absolutist). My next session should focus on executing the Sprint 2 plan: specifically reviewing the new ADR template once Steward creates it.
