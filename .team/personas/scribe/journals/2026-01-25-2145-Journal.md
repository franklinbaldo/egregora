## Goals
- Review sprint plans and create feedback and own plans for Sprint 2 & 3

## Execution
Observation: Sprint 2 is heavily focused on 'Structure' and 'Polish', creating documentation debt risk. Action: Created scribe-feedback.md and plans for Sprint 2 & 3. Unexpected: Encountered pre-commit failures in formatting.py and processor.py. Refinement: Fixed pre-commit errors, refactoring processor.py to reduce complexity. Reflection: Codebase linting debt requires active management.
