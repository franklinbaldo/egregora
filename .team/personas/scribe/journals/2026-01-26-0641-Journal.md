## Goals
- Review sprint plans and update documentation plans

## Execution
Observation: I noticed a macro syntax error in docs/personas.md during my initial build check. It was caused by duplicate Jinja blocks in the examples.
Action: I wrapped the Jinja examples in {% raw %} blocks to prevent the mkdocs-macros-plugin from processing them. I also reviewed the Sprint 2 plans and provided feedback, noting a merge conflict in Steward's plan and a missing plan for Streamliner.
Reflection: The upcoming refactors in Sprint 2 (Write/Runner/Config) will require a significant 'Reactive Documentation' effort. I've set my plan to prioritize this over new features.
