## Execution
Observation: The documentation site template was missing MathJax configuration, and naive addition of CDN links would violate privacy. Action: I implemented a privacy-compliant solution by leveraging the mkdocs-material 'privacy' plugin. I added 'mathjax.js' for instant navigation support and the CDN link, verifying that the plugin bundles the asset locally. I also updated the configuration comment to be explicit about this behavior. Reflection: Privacy compliance can coexist with CDN usage if build-time bundling is verified. This pattern should be documented for future assets.
