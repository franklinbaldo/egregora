## Goals
- Review sprint plans and update documentation plans

## Execution
Observation: The 'enable-auto-merge' CI check failed, likely due to a known infrastructure issue. The review feedback was generic. I decided to fix broken link warnings in docs/personas.md to improve the PR quality.
Action: I replaced relative links to non-docs files in docs/personas.md with absolute GitHub URLs using the {{ config.repo_url }} Jinja variable. I verified this with a clean mkdocs build.
Reflection: The documentation build is now cleaner. I am submitting the changes, acknowledging that the auto-merge failure is out of my control.
