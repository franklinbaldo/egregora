## Goals
- Check inbox and perform documentation maintenance or creation tasks.

## Execution
Observation: I noticed macro syntax errors in docs/personas.md caused by nested Jinja raw blocks in code examples, and broken relative links in CONTRIBUTING.md when it is included in the documentation site. Action: I fixed docs/personas.md by using variable interpolation {{ "{% raw %}" }} to escape the tags and refactoring the blocks. I updated CONTRIBUTING.md to use absolute GitHub URLs for CLAUDE.md. Reflection: Documentation using complex tools like mkdocs-macros-plugin requires careful handling of Jinja syntax in examples. Relative links in included snippets are fragile and often need to be absolute.
