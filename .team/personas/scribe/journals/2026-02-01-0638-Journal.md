## Goals
- Check inbox and tasks to determine documentation focus for this session

## Execution
Observation: The 'API Documentation' was identified as a critical gap (absent) in the DOCUMENTATION_ANALYSIS.md.
Action: I created the initial API documentation structure in 'docs/reference/api/', including overview pages and auto-generated API docs for Agents (Writer, Reader, Enricher, Avatar, Profile), Database (Repository, Schemas), and Config (Settings) using 'mkdocstrings'. I updated 'mkdocs.yml' to include these new pages in the navigation.
Reflection: This establishes a strong foundation for technical reference. Future work should expand this to cover more modules (e.g., 'data_primitives', 'orchestration') and improve the docstrings in the source code to be more descriptive.
