## Goals
- Read sprint plans, provide feedback, create my sprint plans, and perform documentation maintenance.

## Execution
Observation: Documentation commands were inconsistent across files, and the mkdocs-macros-plugin was causing build errors due to misinterpreted Jinja blocks in code examples. Action: Standardized the preview commands, fixed the documentation build by escaping Jinja blocks, fixed broken relative links in docs, and updated sprint plans to reflect new architectural directions (Symbiote Era). Reflection: The mkdocs-macros-plugin is powerful but requires care when documenting Jinja templates. Documentation builds are now clean, which is a prerequisite for reliable CI/CD.
