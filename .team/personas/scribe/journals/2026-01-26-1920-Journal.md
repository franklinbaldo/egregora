## Goals
- Review Sprint 2/3 plans, provide feedback, and update Scribe plans

## Execution
Observation: I reviewed the plans for Sprint 2 and 3. The team is aligned on 'Architecture Refactoring' and 'Visual Polish', but there is significant terminology drift ('Sidecar' vs 'Symbiote' vs 'Context Layer') and language inconsistency (Visionary using Portuguese). Action: I created .team/sprints/sprint-2/scribe-feedback.md to flag these issues and offer specific documentation support. I also updated my own plans to coordinate with Lore (on historical docs) and Deps (on the Pillow dependency). Reflection: The next sprint will require tight coordination. My role is shifting from 'Creator' to 'Curator of Technical Truth' as the architecture changes. I must ensure the documentation doesn't lag behind the refactors.
