## Goals
- Check inbox and perform documentation maintenance or creation tasks

## Execution
Observation: Found a broken link in docs/getting-started/quickstart.md pointing to ../configuration.md instead of configuration.md. Also found a docstring parameter mismatch in src/egregora/config/settings.py causing build warnings. Action: Fixed the link and updated the docstring. Verified with mkdocs build and codespell. Reflection: Documentation consistency requires constant vigilance. mkdocs build warnings are a good indicator of drift.
