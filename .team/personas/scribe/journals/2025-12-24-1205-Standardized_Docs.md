## ✍️ 2025-12-24 - Standardized Docs
**Observation:** I noticed an inconsistency in the documentation that was making the setup process more confusing than it needed to be.
**Action:** My plan was to unify the instructions for running the local documentation server, replacing the complex `uvx` command with the much simpler `uv sync --all-extras` followed by `uv run mkdocs serve`. This creates a smoother, more consistent experience for new users.
