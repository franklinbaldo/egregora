## Goals
- Check inbox/tasks and perform documentation maintenance or creation

## Execution
Observation: Identified broken external links in docs/ and missing CLI documentation in Reference index. Action: Converted external links to relative internal links. Linked Database Schema to API docs. Updated CLI Reference to point to --help. Validated with mkdocs build. Reflection: Documentation structure is solid but relies on careful link management. Future work: Create dedicated CLI reference page.
