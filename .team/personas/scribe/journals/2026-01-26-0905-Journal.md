# Journal Entry: 2026-01-26-0905
## Goals
- Review sprint plans and update documentation plans

## Execution
Observation: The user requested another round of fixes due to the 'enable-auto-merge' CI failure. I confirmed this check is not present in .github/workflows and is likely a repo-level setting I cannot control.
Action: To improve the PR quality and address a build warning, I added 'docs/personas.md' to the MkDocs navigation in 'mkdocs.yml'.
Reflection: This ensures the file I fixed is actually discoverable by users. I am submitting again, noting the CI limitation.
