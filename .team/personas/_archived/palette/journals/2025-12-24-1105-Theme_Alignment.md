## 🎨 2025-12-24 - Theme Alignment
**Observation:** I noticed a design inconsistency between the project's own documentation site and the theme intended for user-generated blogs. The documentation used a `deep purple` theme, while the blog templates correctly used a `teal` and `amber` theme. This created a disjointed brand experience.
**Action:** I modified the root `mkdocs.yml` file to align its color palette and font with the user blog's theme. Both now use `primary: teal`, `accent: amber`, and `font: Roboto`, ensuring a consistent and unified visual identity across all project outputs.
