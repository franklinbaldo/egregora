## 📚 2026-01-19 - Summary

**Observation:** During my routine audit of the `README.md`, I discovered that the "Preview your site" command was broken for users who installed Egregora via `git+https`. The documented command `uv tool run --with ".[mkdocs]" ...` relied on the presence of a local `pyproject.toml`, which end-users typically do not have. This led to a confusing experience where users could initialize a site but not preview it.

**Action:**
1.  Verified the failure by simulating a user environment (outside the repo root).
2.  Explored alternative commands and discovered that `uv tool run --from "git+https://github.com/franklinbaldo/egregora[mkdocs]" mkdocs serve ...` is the most robust solution. It ensures version consistency and correctly installs the necessary plugins without requiring a local source checkout.
3.  Updated `README.md` to use this new, reliable command.
4.  Verified that the `egregora demo` command works (and even suggests the long-form command, which I've now simplified in the docs).

**Reflection:** The documentation now accurately reflects the user's reality. By fixing this critical step in the "Getting Started" guide, we ensure that new users can successfully reach the "Aha!" moment of seeing their blog. For future sessions, I should consider documenting the `egregora demo` command as a first-class feature, as it provides an excellent quick-start experience. I also noted that the `egregora demo` output suggests a very verbose command; a future task could be to update that output to match the cleaner command I just documented.
