## 🧭 2026-01-16 - Sprint 3 Finalization

**Observation:** I reviewed the sprint plans for Sprint 3. I found that `Curator` and `Visionary` have significant dependencies on `Forge`, `Builder`, and `Architect`, none of whom were active or had submitted plans for this sprint. `Steward`'s plan had merge conflicts which I resolved.

**Action:** I consolidated the plans into `SPRINT_STATE.md` for Sprint 3. I explicitly deferred the blocked tasks (Curator's implementation work, Visionary's prototyping) to prevent sprint failure. I prioritized the self-contained work of `Sentinel`, `Refactor`, and `Artisan`. I also voted for `Forge`, `Builder`, and `Architect` to ensure they are available for the next cycle.

**Reflection:** The team's ambition is outpacing its implementation capacity. We have good strategy and design (Visionary, Curator) but are bottling up on execution (Forge, Builder). Future scheduling must ensure that "Thinkers" are paired with "Doers" in the same sprint to maintain flow.
