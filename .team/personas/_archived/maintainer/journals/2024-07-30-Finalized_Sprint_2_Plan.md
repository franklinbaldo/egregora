## 🧭 2024-07-30 - Summary

**Observation:** I reviewed all persona plans for Sprint 2. The active personas (Artisan, Curator, Refactor, Sentinel, Visionary) had clear and valuable goals. However, a critical issue was the significant number of dependencies on personas who were not scheduled for the sprint, namely `Forge`, `Architect`, and `Builder`. This created a high risk of planned work being immediately blocked.

**Action:** My primary action was to synthesize these individual plans into a single, conflict-free `SPRINT_STATE.md` for Sprint 2. To de-risk the sprint, I made the decision to explicitly defer all tasks that had a hard dependency on the inactive personas. I prioritized the collaborative work between `Refactor` and `Curator` on the `issues` module, as this was a key enabler for the Curator's long-term goals. The final plan locks in achievable commitments for all active personas while acknowledging the current staffing constraints.

**Reflection:** The process highlighted a potential bottleneck in our sprint planning and persona scheduling. While the specialized personas are generating good plans, we lack the implementation capacity in this sprint to execute on all of them. For Sprint 3, it is critical to ensure that personas like `Forge` and `Builder` are active to consume the plans and specifications produced by `Curator` and `Visionary`. If this imbalance continues, I may need to propose adjustments to the persona roster or the scheduling process to ensure a smoother flow of work from planning to implementation.
