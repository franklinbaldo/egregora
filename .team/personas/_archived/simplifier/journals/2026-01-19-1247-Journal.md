## Execution
## 📉 2026-01-20 - Consolidate Database Backend Creation Logic

**Observation:**
The 'write' pipeline contained a duplicated implementation of database backend creation ( and its nested ) which mirrored logic already present in . This redundancy violated DRY and led to inconsistent URI validation logic between the factory and the pipeline implementation.

**Action:**
I removed the duplicated  and  functions from . I refactored  in  to use a module-level  helper (which now correctly uses ) and updated  to delegate to the factory method. I also updated  to correctly verify the normalized URI format produced by  (checking for 3 slashes for absolute paths instead of the previous 4).

**Reflection:**
This change centralizes the critical logic for establishing database connections. By forcing all consumers to go through  (or eventually a dedicated connection utility), we ensure that policies like URI normalization and scheme validation are applied consistently across the application. The removal of the 'write' pipeline's private implementation reduces the surface area for bugs and simplifies the module.
