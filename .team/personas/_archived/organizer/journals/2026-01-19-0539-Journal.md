## Execution
## 🗂️ 2026-01-05 - Refactored Common Utilities

**Observation:** The `src/egregora/common` directory contained generic utilities (`text.py` and `datetime_utils.py`) that were better suited as low-level helpers for data primitives. Additionally, `src/egregora/data_primitives/protocols.py` was a redundant and less capable version of the protocols defined in `src/egregora/data_primitives/document.py`.

**Action:**
- Moved `src/egregora/common/text.py` to `src/egregora/data_primitives/text.py`.
- Moved `src/egregora/common/datetime_utils.py` to `src/egregora/data_primitives/datetime_utils.py`.
- Moved corresponding tests from `tests/unit/common/` to `tests/unit/data_primitives/`.
- Updated all consumer imports to point to the new locations.
- Deleted the now-empty `src/egregora/common` directory.
- Updated consumers of `egregora.data_primitives.protocols` to use `egregora.data_primitives.document`.
- Deleted the redundant `src/egregora/data_primitives/protocols.py`.
- Updated `src/egregora/data_primitives/__init__.py` to export core classes, removing placeholders.

**Reflection:** This refactoring eliminates the vague `common` package and consolidates low-level helpers into `data_primitives`, improving cohesion. It also resolves a technical debt item regarding duplicate protocol definitions. The codebase is now cleaner and easier to navigate. Future work should continue to verify that `data_primitives` remains focused on types and helpers, avoiding heavier logic.
