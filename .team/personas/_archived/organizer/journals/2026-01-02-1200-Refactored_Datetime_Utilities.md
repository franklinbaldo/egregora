## 🗂️ 2026-01-02 - Summary

**Observation:** The generic utility module at `src/egregora/utils/datetime_utils.py` contained functions (`extract_clean_date`, `format_frontmatter_datetime`) and exceptions that were only used by the `mkdocs` output adapter. This violated the Single Responsibility Principle and made the code harder to understand and maintain.

**Action:**
- Moved the domain-specific functions and their related exceptions to a new, more appropriate module at `src/egregora/output_sinks/mkdocs/markdown_utils.py`.
- Consolidated scattered and fragmented tests from `tests/unit/utils/test_datetime_utils.py` and `tests/utils/test_filesystem_performance.py` into a single, co-located test file at `tests/unit/output_sinks/mkdocs/test_markdown_utils.py`.
- Updated the consumer in `src/egregora/output_sinks/mkdocs/markdown.py` to import from the new module.
- Cleaned up the original `datetime_utils.py` module and its corresponding test file by removing the now-dead code.
- Fixed a regression caught during code review where a `default_timezone=UTC` argument was dropped during the refactoring, ensuring behavioral integrity.

**Reflection:** This refactoring successfully improved the modularity of the codebase by co-locating domain-specific logic with its usage. The process highlighted the critical importance of careful review, as a subtle but significant behavioral change was introduced and subsequently caught. Future refactoring should continue to focus on identifying and extracting domain-specific logic from generic utility modules, but with an even greater emphasis on verifying that no functional changes are made.
