## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: Identified type shadowing of 'list' in src/egregora/output_sinks/base.py where a method named 'list' conflicted with type annotations. Also found a Path argument type error.
Action: Resolved shadowing by using 'builtins.list' in type annotations. Fixed Path argument by casting to string. Addressed a pre-commit failure in tests/step_defs/test_reader_steps.py involving function redefinition.
Reflection: Type shadowing can be subtle when using 'from __future__ import annotations'. Using 'builtins.list' is a robust fix without needing aliases.
