## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: Identified BaseOutputSink in src/egregora/output_sinks/base.py had several mypy errors including shadowed list method used as type and incompatible Path argument. Action: Imported builtins and replaced usage of list[...] with builtins.list[...] inside the class. Fixed Path construction by validating input. Refined return types to strict types. Reflection: The file is now clean in mypy.
