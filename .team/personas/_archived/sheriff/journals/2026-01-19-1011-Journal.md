## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Fixed flaky tests in 'reader' domain.
**Observation:** The 'reader' agent tests were failing heavily (26 failures) due to API drift (PostComparison signature, EloStore.UpdateParams, Ibis returns).
**Action:**
1. Updated  to match current  and  APIs.
2. Implemented  to handle pytest-bdd list-of-lists datatables.
3. Added missing step definitions and fixed logic errors in feedback/rating assertions.
4. Removed premature optimization in  to fix unbalanced pairing logic.
5. Verified stability with 20 consecutive runs of the test suite.
**Reflection:** The test suite had drifted significantly from the implementation. The fix involved both test updates and a small logic fix in the runner to ensure graph regularity.
