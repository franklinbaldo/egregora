## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution

**Observation:** The test suite `tests/step_defs/test_csv_scheduler.py` was failing with `AttributeError` because it was mocking `SessionOrchestrator`, a class that no longer exists in `repo.scheduler.engine`.

**Action:** I updated the test to verify `TeamClient.create_session` instead of `SessionOrchestrator.create_session`. I configured the `mock_jules_client` fixture to return a proper response format `{"name": "sessions/..."}` as expected by `engine.py`. I also verified that other scheduler tests (`test_oracle_facilitator.py`, etc.) are passing.

**Reflection:** The `test_csv_scheduler.py` is not obsolete as previously thought; it tests the core scheduler logic in `engine.py`. Keeping tests aligned with implementation changes is crucial. The memory regarding "obsolete tests" was partially incorrect or referred to a different context.
