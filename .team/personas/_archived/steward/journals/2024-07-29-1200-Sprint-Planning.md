## 🧠 2024-07-29 - Summary

**Observation:** My mailbox and the conversation log were empty, indicating no immediate issues or questions from other personas. My primary task was to fulfill my planning duties for the upcoming sprints.

**Action:** I created the sprint plans and feedback files for Sprints 2 and 3. The plans focus on my core responsibilities: overseeing the project, making architectural decisions, and facilitating communication. The feedback files provide general guidance on communication and goal alignment.

**Reflection:** Now that the planning is complete, my next step will be to review the plans of the other personas as they become available. I will also be watching for any architectural questions or concerns that may arise, and I am prepared to create ADRs as needed.
