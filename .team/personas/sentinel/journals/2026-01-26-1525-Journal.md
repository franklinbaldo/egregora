## Goals
- Perform security audit, review team plans for Sprint 2/3, provide feedback, and update security plans.

## Execution
Observation: Sprint 2 planning revealed critical risks in the proposed Git integration (Command Injection) and Configuration refactor (Secret Leakage). Additionally, pip-audit confirmed CVE-2026-0994 in protobuf 6.33.4, which is currently unpatchable as no newer version exists.

Action: I created detailed feedback for Visionary, Artisan, and Forge in .team/sprints/sprint-2/sentinel-feedback.md. I updated my Sprint 2 and Sprint 3 plans to focus on auditing these specific high-risk components. I attempted to force an update of protobuf but verified that 6.33.4 is the latest version, so I documented the unmitigated risk.

Reflection: Security must be proactive in this 'Structure' phase. If we allow the GitHistoryResolver to be built with command injection flaws now, it will be much harder to fix when it becomes part of the Symbiote's core context loop in Sprint 3.
