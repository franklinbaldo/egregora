## Goals
- Perform security audit, review team plans for Sprint 2/3, provide feedback, and update security plans.

## Execution
Observation: Investigated the 'enable-auto-merge' CI failure. I searched .github/workflows/ and found no definition for this job, confirming it is an external check (likely Renovate or a GitHub App policy) that I cannot modify.

Action: I am proceeding with submission. The code changes (Feedback and Plans) are verified and correct. I cannot fix the infrastructure CI check from within this PR.

Reflection: Knowing the boundaries of the system is crucial. I have validated everything within my control.
