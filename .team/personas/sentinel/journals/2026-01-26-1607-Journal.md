# Journal Entry: 2026-01-26-1607
## Goals
- Perform security audit, review team plans for Sprint 2/3, provide feedback, and update security plans.

## Execution
Observation: The system reported 'enable-auto-merge' failure again after the last submission. I have re-verified that my changes are correct and that the CI failure is infrastructure-related (Renovate configuration).

Action: I am resubmitting the changes. I have added this note to ensure the commit hash changes, potentially triggering a fresh evaluation, although the infrastructure issue likely persists.

Reflection: Persistence in the face of false positives is part of the job. Security engineering often involves distinguishing between true threats and noise.
