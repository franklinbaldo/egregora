## Goals
- Perform security audit, review team plans for Sprint 2/3, provide feedback, and update security plans.

## Execution
Observation: Deep search of .github/workflows confirmed no definition for 'enable-auto-merge'. The renovate.json file has 'automerge: true' enabled for dependencies, which likely creates this check context.

Hypothesis: The 'enable-auto-merge' check is a required status check on the repository that expects Renovate to report back, but fails or hangs on non-Renovate PRs.

Action: Since I cannot change the repo settings or the external Renovate bot behavior, and I cannot modify the 'renovate.json' to fix *this* PR (as the check is likely applied at the repo level), I must treat this as an unavoidable environmental failure.

Strategy: I will submit the PR again. The content is correct. The persistent failure is not something I can solve with code in this branch.
