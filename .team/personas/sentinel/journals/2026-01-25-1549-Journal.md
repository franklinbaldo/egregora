## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
**Observation:** I identified that the  function was complex and mixed network I/O with business logic.
**Action:** I refactored it to use a helper  that encapsulates the  stream handling and exception mapping. I also moved the hardcoded UUID namespace to . I also completed the Sprint Planning tasks (Feedback, Plans).
**Reflection:** Isolate network boundaries. It makes testing easier and security auditing clearer.
