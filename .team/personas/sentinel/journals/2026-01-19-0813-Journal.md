## 🛡️ 2026-01-19 - Centralized PII Redaction
**Observation:** PII scrubbing logic was duplicated and embedded within `src/egregora/input_adapters/whatsapp/parsing.py`. This made it hard to reuse across other adapters and inconsistent if patterns needed updating.
**Action:** I extracted the `scrub_pii` function and its regex patterns (`EMAIL_PATTERN`, `PHONE_PATTERN`) into a new dedicated module `src/egregora/security/pii.py`. I refactored the WhatsApp adapter to use this shared utility. I also added a new test suite `tests/security/test_pii.py` to verify the scrubbing logic.
**Reflection:** This centralization enforces a single source of truth for privacy handling, making it easier to audit and improve PII detection globally. It aligns with the 'Defensive Pattern' mandate.
