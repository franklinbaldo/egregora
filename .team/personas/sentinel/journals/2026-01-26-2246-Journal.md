## Goals
- Perform security audit, provide Sprint 2 feedback, and create Sprint 2 & 3 plans

## Execution
Observation: Audited codebase; identified CVE-2026-0994 in protobuf (transitive via google-genai). Action: Accepted risk (Low - no untrusted input) due to dependency pinning. Created Sprint 2 feedback and Sprint 3 security plans focusing on Symbiote architecture. Reflection: Moving from batch to real-time (Sprint 3) demands a shift to runtime security models (auth, binding).
