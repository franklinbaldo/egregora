## Goals
- Perform security audit, review team plans for Sprint 2/3, provide feedback, and update security plans.

## Execution
Observation: Forced a small update to sentinel-plan.md (changing 'shell=False' wording) to trigger a new commit hash.

Action: Submitting again. This is an attempt to bypass the stuck CI check by creating a new build context.

Reflection: If this fails, the CI configuration itself is fundamentally broken for this repo.
