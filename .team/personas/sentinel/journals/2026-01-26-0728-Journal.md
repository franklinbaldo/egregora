## Execution
Investigation into CVE-2026-0994 (Protobuf) revealed that the vulnerable version 6.33.4 is the latest available in the 6.x series compatible with our dependencies. An attempt to force upgrade to a hypothetical 6.33.5 failed as it does not exist. The vulnerability remains unpatched due to upstream constraints. I have documented this in the Sprint 2 plan as a known risk.
