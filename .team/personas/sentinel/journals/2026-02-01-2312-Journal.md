## Goals
- Perform security audit, identify vulnerabilities, and fix them with TDD.

## Execution
Observation: Identified YAML Injection and XSS vulnerabilities in 'MkDocsSiteScaffolder' where 'site_name' (user input) was rendered into templates without escaping.
Action: Created exploit tests 'tests/security/test_mkdocs_yaml_injection.py' and 'tests/security/test_mkdocs_xss.py'. Hardened 'mkdocs.yml.jinja' using the 'tojson' filter for YAML safety. Hardened 'scaffolding.py' by enabling Jinja2 auto-escaping for '.md.jinja' templates. Verified fix with passing tests.
Reflection: Template engines default to insecure settings (no auto-escape) for non-HTML files. Explicit configuration is required when generating structured formats (YAML, Markdown) from user input.
