## Goals
- Perform security audit, fix immediate vulnerabilities, and enforce defensive patterns.

## Execution
Observation: Identified external CDN usage (MathJax) and Google Fonts in MkDocs configuration, violating the 'Privacy-First' principle. Action: Removed external links and disabled automatic font loading in both 'mkdocs.yml' and the template 'src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/mkdocs.yml.jinja'. Added a regression test 'tests/security/test_mkdocs_privacy.py' to prevent re-introduction. Reflection: Configuration hardening is as important as code hardening. Default templates often include privacy leaks.
