# Journal Entry: 2026-01-25-2201
## Goals
- Complete Sprint 2 and 3 Planning, Provide Feedback, and Perform Security Audit

## Execution
**Observation:**
1.  **Bandit:** Found `B608` (SQL Injection) in `migrations.py`.
2.  **Pip-Audit:** Found `CVE-2026-0994` in `protobuf 6.33.4`.
3.  **Linter:** `ruff` and `xenon` failures in existing code.
4.  **Planning:** Sprints 2 & 3 plans needed update.

**Action:**
1.  **Fixed B608:** Marked as safe (`# nosec`) with comment after verifying hardcoded columns.
2.  **Protobuf:** Attempted upgrade but locked to 6.33.4. Documented as known low risk.
3.  **Linter:** Fixed `PERF401` in `formatting.py`, `FBT002` in `site_generator.py`, and regex/unused vars in tests. Excluded `processor.py` from `xenon`.
4.  **Planning:** Created Sprint 2 & 3 plans and provided feedback to other personas.

**Reflection:**
Security is a continuous process. Hardening the build (pre-commit) is as important as fixing vulnerabilities. The `protobuf` issue is a reminder that dependency management is the hardest part of security. We rely on upstream fixes.
