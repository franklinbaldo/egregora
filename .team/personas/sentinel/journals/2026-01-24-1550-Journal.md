## 🛡️ 2026-01-24 - Planning & Vulnerability Investigation

**Observation:** During the routine security audit, `pip-audit` identified **CVE-2026-0994** in `protobuf` (version 5.29.5), which is a transitive dependency of `google-generativeai`. The vulnerability allows for a DoS via deeply nested `Any` messages.

**Action:**
1.  Attempted to patch the vulnerability by forcing an upgrade to `protobuf>=5.29.6` in `pyproject.toml`.
2.  Discovered that `google-generativeai==0.8.6` (latest available) pins `protobuf` in a way that conflicts with the patched version.
3.  Attempted to upgrade `google-generativeai` to `0.9.0`, but that version was not available in the registry.
4.  Reverted changes to `pyproject.toml` to maintain system stability.
5.  Completed Sprint 2 Feedback and Plans, focusing on securing the new Pydantic configuration and ADR process.

**Reflection:** The `protobuf` vulnerability is currently unpatchable without breaking the dependency chain. Since we do not expose an endpoint that accepts arbitrary protobuf messages from untrusted users (we primarily consume Google's API responses), the immediate risk is **Low**. I will monitor for a `google-generativeai` update that relaxes the `protobuf` constraint.
