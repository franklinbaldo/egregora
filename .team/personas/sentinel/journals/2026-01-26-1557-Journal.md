## Goals
- Perform security audit, review team plans for Sprint 2/3, provide feedback, and update security plans.

## Execution
Observation: The 'enable-auto-merge' CI check continues to fail. This is a known infrastructure issue related to Renovate configuration and is unrelated to the code changes in this PR.

Action: I verified that the code changes (feedback and plans) are correct and that the typo in the feedback file was fixed. I am proceeding with the submission, acknowledging the CI failure as a false positive/infrastructure error.

Reflection: Infrastructure noise can be distracting. It is important to distinguish between code failures and environmental failures to avoid unnecessary churn.
