## Goals
- Perform security audit, fix immediate vulnerabilities, and complete Sprint 2 & 3 planning.

## Execution

**Observation:** Ran security audit.  was clean.  flagged  6.33.4 with CVE-2026-0994. Investigation showed this is the latest version, and the latest 5.x version (5.29.5) is also vulnerable. The vulnerability is blocked by lack of upstream patches.
**Action:** Reviewed Sprint 2 and 3 plans. Provided feedback to team members regarding language consistency (Visionary), refactoring risks (Simplifier/Artisan), and input validation (Forge). Created  for Sprint 2 and 3 focusing on ADR security, configuration hardening, and RAG pipeline auditing.
**Reflection:** The massive refactoring in Sprint 2 creates a high risk of security context loss (e.g., losing rate limits or validation logic during code moves). I must prioritize regression testing for the  and  modules.
