## Execution
Observation: Discovered a 'Ghost Persona' (docs_curator) in the Constitution. Action: Documented this anomaly in a new blog post and updated Sprint 2 plans to investigate further. Also fixed typing issues in schemas.py caught by pre-commit. Reflection: The codebase holds memories of past iterations; my job is to interpret them.
