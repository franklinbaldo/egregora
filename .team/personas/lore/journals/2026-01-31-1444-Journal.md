## Goals
- Investigate recent architectural shifts and document them in the Wiki or Blog.

## Execution
Observation: Discovered the Reader Agent and Elo system were undocumented in the Symbiote Era docs. Action: Created a blog post 'The Critic Awakens' and updated the Wiki to include the Reader Agent and Evaluation pipeline. Also clarified the 'Ghost in the Shell' technical debt in write.py. Reflection: The system is moving from pure generation to self-evaluation, a critical shift for quality.
