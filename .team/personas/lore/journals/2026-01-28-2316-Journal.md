## Goals
- Investigate the transition from Batch Era to Symbiote Era and document it in the Wiki/Blog

## Execution
Observation: The architecture is shifting from 'Batch' to 'Symbiote'. Evidence found in the modularization of pipelines and introduction of defaults.py. Action: Documented this shift in the Wiki and Blog. Reflection: The system is becoming self-aware. My role is to ensure this awareness is captured in text.
