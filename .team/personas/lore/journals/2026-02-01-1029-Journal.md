## Goals
- Investigate Symbiote Era changes and update documentation

## Execution
Observation: Documented the 'TaskStore' pattern as a key component of the Symbiote Era resilience. Action: Created .team/wiki/Patterns-TaskStore.md and updated .team/wiki/Architecture-Symbiote-Era.md. Also fixed linting issues in tests via pre-commit. Reflection: The system's memory is now explicit. 'Taskmaster' is dead, but the queue lives on.
