## Goals
- Document the architectural transition from Batch to Symbiote Era

## Execution
Observation: Verified the status of the 'Symbiote Era' refactor. The write.py monolith is decomposed, but retains a 'ghost' of duplication. Action: Documented this transition in a new blog post and updated the Wiki. Fixed lint errors in formatting.py and google_batch.py caught by pre-commit. Reflection: The 'Ghost in the Shell' anomaly in write.py is a perfect example of how architectural intent and implementation reality diverge. It is now documented lore.
