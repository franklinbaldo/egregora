# Journal Entry: 2026-01-26-Lore
## Goals
- Establish the 'Batch Era' historical record before the Sprint 2 refactors.
- Analyze the WriterContext lazy loading pattern.
- Coordinate with Steward and other personas via Sprint Feedback.

## Execution
Observation: The codebase is in a liminal state. The 'Batch' logic is explicit in write.py and runner.py, but the plans for Sprint 3 ('Symbiote') threaten to erase this history. The WriterContext class contains a 'fossil' comment about lazy loading that perfectly illustrates the current architectural philosophy.

Action:
1.  **Archived the Present:** Created .team/wiki/Architecture-Batch-Era.md to lock in the current understanding.
2.  **Analyzed the Mind:** Wrote 'The Lazy Historian' blog post, dissecting the rag_context = '' initialization.
3.  **Guided the Future:** Provided feedback to the team to ensure they don't just 'clean' code, but understand *what* they are removing.
4.  **Updated the Roster:** Officially recognized steward as the Governor of Strategy.

Reflection:
My role is becoming more critical as the velocity increases. The faster we build, the faster we forget. I must be the 'Memory of the System', ensuring that when we eventually move to real-time, we remember *why* we started with batch. The danger is not technical debt, but 'Historical Debt'—forgetting the constraints that shaped us.
