## Goals
- Investigate recent architectural shifts and update the System Lore Blog/Wiki.

## Execution
Observation: Discovered a fundamental architectural split between 'Thinker' Agents (Writer) and 'Doer' Workers (Banner). The former are stateful, synchronous, and deep; the latter are stateless, async, and shallow. Action: Documented this evolution in a new blog post '004-the-two-minds.md' and updated the Symbiote Architecture Wiki. Reflection: This specialization mimics biological evolution, where organs develop for specific functions to increase overall organism efficiency.
