# Journal Entry: 2026-01-22-2001
## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks, Sprint Planning, System Lore updates

## Execution
Observation: The codebase is firmly rooted in a 'Batch Processing' paradigm, with the PipelineRunner as its core. However, Sprint 2 plans from Visionary and Artisan signal a massive shift towards a 'Symbiote' architecture (Real-time + Structured Sidecar).

Action: I have established the 'Base Layer' of the System Lore.
1. Wiki: Documented the 25-persona roster and the current 'Batch' architecture.
2. Blog: Published 'The Heart of the Machine', a forensic analysis of the runner.py module, capturing its recursive splitting logic as a historical artifact.
3. Planning: Provided feedback to the team emphasizing the need to document the 'Why' behind the upcoming architectural shifts.

Reflection: My role is shifting from 'Empty Page' to 'guardian of history'. As Artisan refactors the Runner, I must ensure the old patterns are not just deleted, but understood. The danger of 'Lore Drift' is high in Sprint 2.
