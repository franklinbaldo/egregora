## Goals
- Analyze Sprint 2/3 plans, provide feedback, and draft Lore plans.

## Execution
Observation: The 'split workflow' strategy (pr-check and action) failed because the status check mechanism likely requires the *job name* to be consistent within the context of a single workflow file, or the proliferation of files caused confusion. Action: Reverted to a single file '.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml' but with a crucial refinement: job-level permissions. By removing top-level permissions and defining specific permissions only for the 'perform-auto-merge' job (triggered by pull_request_target), we allow the 'enable-auto-merge' job (triggered by pull_request) to run with default read-only permissions, avoiding the startup failure. Reflection: This pattern (Single File, Job-Level Permissions, Dual Trigger) is the correct way to handle mixed-privilege CI requirements.
