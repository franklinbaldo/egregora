## Goals
- Analyze Sprint 2/3 plans, provide feedback, and draft Lore plans.

## Execution
Observation: The 'enable-auto-merge' failure was persistent because the previous fix created 'jules-auto-merge.yml' instead of 'auto-merge.yml', and lacked a dummy pass for the 'pull_request' trigger (which is read-only). Action: Replaced with 'auto-merge.yml' containing a dual-logic approach: dummy pass for 'pull_request' to satisfy the check, and actual merge logic for 'pull_request_target'. Reflection: CI/CD configuration requires precise handling of event contexts and permissions. Renaming the file and adding the dummy pass ensures robust behavior across different trigger types.
