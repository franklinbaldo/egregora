## Goals
- Investigate recent system changes and document significant architectural shifts in the Wiki or Blog.

## Execution
Observation: Investigated the Writer Agent and discovered a sophisticated 'Composition Root' pattern separating orchestration (writer.py), memory (writer_context.py), and skills (writer_helpers.py/tools). Also noted the 'Illusion of Concurrency' in the legacy Enricher being addressed by a decomposition refactor. Action: Documented the Writer Agent architecture in a new Wiki page, updated the Symbiote Era overview, and published a deep-dive blog post 'The Symbiote's Nervous System'. Reflection: The move from monolithic scripts to assembled agents is the defining characteristic of this era. Next steps should focus on the 'Reader Agent' integration and full TaskStore adoption for the Writer.
