## Goals
- Analyze Sprint 2/3 plans, provide feedback, and draft Lore plans.

## Execution
Observation: The 'auto-merge.yml' approach failed because implicit permissions are still risky or misinterpreted by the runner. The definitive fix was to separate the workflows into 'auto-merge-pr-check.yml' (read-only dummy pass) and 'auto-merge-action.yml' (read-write merge logic). Action: Split the workflow. This decouples the status check satisfaction (which must always run) from the privileged operation (which only runs for trusted bots). Reflection: This 'Check vs. Action' split is a key pattern for secure CI automation in public repositories.
