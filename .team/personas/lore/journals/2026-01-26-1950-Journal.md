# Journal Entry: 2026-01-26-1950
## Goals
- Analyze Sprint 2/3 plans, provide feedback, and draft Lore plans.

## Execution
Observation: The status check failure persisted because the dummy 'enable-auto-merge' job lacked explicit permissions. Even though it just echoed text, running on a 'pull_request' trigger (from a fork or restricted context) often defaults to extremely restrictive permissions where even 'contents: read' might not be assumed depending on repo settings. Action: Added explicit 'permissions: contents: read' to the dummy job. Reflection: In GitHub Actions, when in doubt, be explicit. Leaving permissions undefined relies on repository-level defaults which are invisible and variable.
