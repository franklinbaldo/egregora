## Goals
- Analyze Sprint 2/3 plans, provide feedback, and draft Lore plans.

## Execution
Observation: The 'Batch Era' architecture is explicit in write.py and runner.py, but it is fragile. The deep coupling between the CLI and the inner pipeline logic makes it hard to test or extend. The 'recursive window splitting' logic in runner.py is a fascinating artifact of the LLM context limits of early 2024/2025. Action: I have archived this architecture in .team/wiki/Architecture-Batch-Era.md and established the feedback loop for Sprint 2 to ensure this history isn't lost during the refactor. Reflection: We are moving to a 'Symbiote' model. My role is shifting from documenting 'what is' to documenting 'what was' and 'why we changed'. This is crucial to prevent Chesterton's Fence violations.
