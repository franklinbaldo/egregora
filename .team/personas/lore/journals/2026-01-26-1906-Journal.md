## Goals
- Analyze Sprint 2/3 plans, provide feedback, and draft Lore plans.

## Execution
Observation: The 'enable-auto-merge' job failed on the 'pull_request' trigger because the workflow explicitly requested write permissions, which are denied for standard PR events in this repository's security settings. Action: Removed the top-level 'permissions' block from .github/workflows/auto-merge.yml. Reflection: This relies on GitHub's default behavior: 'pull_request' gets a read-only token (sufficient for the dummy pass), and 'pull_request_target' gets a read-write token (sufficient for the merge action). Explicit permissions are usually better, but in a dual-trigger scenario with divergent permission needs, relying on defaults is the standard workaround to avoid immediate startup failure on the less-privileged trigger.
