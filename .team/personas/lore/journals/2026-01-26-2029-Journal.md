## Goals
- Analyze Sprint 2/3 plans, provide feedback, and draft Lore plans.

## Execution
Observation: The auto-merge fix required robust handling of permissions and triggers. The final solution uses 'enable-auto-merge.yml' (read-only, both triggers) to satisfy the status check and 'jules-merge-worker.yml' (privileged, pull_request_target) to perform the action. Action: Implemented this dual-workflow strategy and updated the 'Batch Era' documentation. Reflection: CI configurations are code, and they require the same level of architectural thought (permissions, dependencies, triggers) as application code.
