## Goals
- Complete Sprint 2 & 3 planning and provide feedback

## Execution
Observation: The system is undergoing a 'Great Refactor'. Sprint 2 plans show a definitive move away from the monolithic scripts of the Batch Era. Action: Created feedback for the team to preserve historical context. Updated my plans to chronicle this transition and the subsequent rise of the 'Symbiote' architecture in Sprint 3. Reflection: My role is pivoting from establishing the past to recording the present before it becomes lost history.
