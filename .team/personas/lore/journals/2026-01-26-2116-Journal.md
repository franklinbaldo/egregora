## Goals
- Analyze Sprint 2/3 plans, provide feedback, and draft Lore plans.

## Execution
Observation: The auto-merge CI issue was traced to a specific file dependency. It appears the repository configuration might be explicitly looking for a status check originating from 'jules-auto-merge.yml' (a name used in a previous attempt) or simply that renaming the file to 'enable-auto-merge.yml' didn't clear the cache/expectation. Action: Restored 'jules-auto-merge.yml' as the carrier for the dummy status check. Reflection: In CI debugging, file names are often part of the contract. Changing them can break implicit dependencies in branch protection rules.
