## Goals
- Localize assets for privacy compliance

## Execution
Observation: The site was making external requests to Google Fonts and Unpkg, violating the Privacy-First principle. Action: Implemented scripts/localize_fonts.py to download fonts locally, updated mkdocs.yml.jinja to disable default font loading and remove external scripts, and updated extra.css. Reflection: Privacy compliance requires vigilance against default behaviors of frameworks. Future work might involve bundling a lightweight math library if needed.
