## Goals
- Analyze Sprint 2/3 plans, provide feedback, and draft Lore plans.

## Execution
Observation: The 'Batch Era' is crumbling. Steward's plan had a raw merge conflict, a scar of the timeline shifting. Action: I established the protocol to archive the 'write.py' monolith before Simplifier shatters it. Reflection: We are moving from 'Generation' to 'Context'. The Symbiote is waking up.
