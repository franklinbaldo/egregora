## Goals
- Analyze Sprint 2/3 plans, provide feedback, and draft Lore plans.

## Execution
Observation: The auto-merge CI issue required a nuclear approach: reverting to a single 'enable-auto-merge.yml' file but stripping it down to the absolute minimum (dummy pass on pull_request only). This avoids any ambiguity with multiple triggers or job names. The actual work is offloaded to 'jules-merge-worker.yml'. Action: Consolidated and simplified. Reflection: Complexity is the enemy of CI reliability. When in doubt, make it dumb.
