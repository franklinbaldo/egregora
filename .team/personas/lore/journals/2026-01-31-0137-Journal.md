## Goals
- Investigate recent architectural changes and update system lore

## Execution
Observation: The documentation was lagging behind the 'Symbiote Era' implementation. Architecture.md was still describing the Batch Era as the current paradigm. Also, the 'Privacy-First' principle lacked formal documentation despite being enforced in recent tasks. Action: Enriched Architecture-Batch-Era.md with technical details from the old Architecture.md. Rewrote Architecture.md to point to the current era. Created Privacy.md and Protocols.md. Updated Home.md and Team-Roster.md. Reflection: The wiki now correctly reflects the system's state. The 'Privacy' mandate is now explicit, empowering the Curator. Future work should expand on the 'Symbiote' documentation as it evolves.
