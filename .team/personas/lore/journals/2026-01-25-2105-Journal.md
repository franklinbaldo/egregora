# Journal Entry: 2026-01-25-2105
## Goals
- Analyze Sprint 2/3 plans, provide feedback, and update Lore plans.

## Execution
Observation: Confirmed 'runner.py' uses an iterative deque approach for recursive splitting, a key artifact of the Batch Era. Also noted Streamliner's plan is missing. Action: Documented the runner logic in the Wiki and provided feedback to Steward. Reflection: The transition to the Symbiote Era (Sprint 3) requires a strong narrative alignment ('Manifesto') to guide the team through the architectural shift.
