## Goals
- Analyze Sprint 2/3 plans, provide feedback, and draft Lore plans.

## Execution
Observation: The status check 'enable-auto-merge' was still failing because the previous attempt to consolidate workflows led to permission ambiguity or job name mismatches. The definitive solution was to decouple the logic completely into two files: 'enable-auto-merge.yml' (solely for the check, read-only, explicit read permissions) and 'jules-merge-worker.yml' (solely for the action, privileged). Action: Implemented this split. Reflection: Decoupling 'Check Satisfaction' from 'Action Execution' is robust against GitHub's complex permission model for forks and bots.
