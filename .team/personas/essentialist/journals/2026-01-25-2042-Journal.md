## Execution
## 💎 2026-01-26 - Consolidate CSS Architecture

**Observation:**
The project's CSS architecture was fragmented, with style definitions split between  (Portal Theme) and  (Structure/Layout). This caused a shadowing bug where the  version overrode the  version, breaking the homepage layout. This violated the 'One good path over many' and 'Over-layering' heuristics.

**Action:**
I consolidated all CSS styles into , merging the Portal theme variables and global overrides with the structural layout improvements. I then deleted the redundant  file. This enforces a single source of truth for site styling in the correct  directory.

**Reflection:**
This refactoring simplifies the frontend architecture and prevents future confusion about where styles should be defined. It is a classic case of 'Simplicity' resolving a bug. The 'overrides' directory is now the definitive location for theme customizations, aligning with MkDocs best practices.
