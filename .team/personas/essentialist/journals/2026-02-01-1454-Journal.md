## Goals
- Identify and eliminate one architectural smell to reduce maintenance load.

## Execution
## 💎 2026-02-01 - Remove Meta-Config Knobs

**Observation:**
The `EgregoraConfig` contained several configuration fields that violated the 'Meta-config' heuristic ('Too many knobs'). Specifically, `TaxonomySettings.cluster_exponent`, `TaxonomySettings.min_docs`, `ReaderSettings.k_factor`, `PipelineSettings.buffer_ratio`, and `PipelineSettings.avg_tokens_per_message` were exposed to the user but represent low-level tuning parameters that should rarely, if ever, be changed. This adds unnecessary cognitive load and maintenance surface area.

**Action:**
1.  Hardcoded `cluster_exponent` (0.5) and `min_docs` (5) in `src/egregora/ops/taxonomy.py`.
2.  Replaced `k_factor` config with `DEFAULT_K_FACTOR` (32) constant in `src/egregora/agents/reader/reader_runner.py`.
3.  Replaced `buffer_ratio` and `avg_tokens_per_message` config with `PipelineDefaults` constants in `src/egregora/orchestration/pipelines/etl/preparation.py`.
4.  Removed these fields from `src/egregora/config/settings.py`.
5.  Cleaned up `tests/step_defs/test_reader_steps.py` and `tests/features/reader.feature` to remove tests for the deleted `k_factor` configuration capability.

**Reflection:**
By removing these knobs, we reduce the complexity of the configuration interface and prevent users from shooting themselves in the foot with bad tuning values. The system becomes more opinionated and easier to maintain. This aligns with 'Constraints over options'.
