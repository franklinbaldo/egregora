## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: The PipelineFactory class was a God object with duplicated logic. Action: Refactored responsibilities to WriterResources.from_pipeline_context and create_and_initialize_adapter. Enhanced setup.py and utils.py to preserve robustness. Deleted PipelineFactory. Reflection: Codebase is simpler and more modular.
