## Goals
- Review tasks and pick a high impact simplification

## Execution
**Observation:** During a routine cleanup of frontend assets, I noticed that  was failing reliably due to two issues: a mismatch between the expected directory name ('demo' vs 'fresh_demo') causing content divergence in , and the presence of ephemeral runtime artifacts (, ) in the generated output which were not ignored by the comparison logic. **Action:** 1. Deleted  and  from  as they were identified as garbage. 2. Verified the cleanup by generating a demo site and inspecting the output. 3. Fixed  by ensuring the test uses the standard  directory name (matching the committed folder) and adding ephemeral artifacts to the comparison ignore list. **Reflection:** This task reinforced the 'Tests over process' heuristic. While the primary goal was deleting files ('Delete over deprecate'), the discovery of a broken test provided an opportunity to improve the system's reliability. A test that fails due to environmental noise (timestamps, random artifacts) is worse than no test. By making the test deterministic and robust against runtime artifacts, we increase confidence in future refactoring.
