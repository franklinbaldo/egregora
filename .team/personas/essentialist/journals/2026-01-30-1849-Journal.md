## Goals
- Identify and eliminate one architectural smell to reduce maintenance load

## Execution
## 💎 2026-01-30 - Localize Assets for Privacy

**Observation:**
The documentation site generated by 'egregora demo' violated the 'Privacy-First' principle by making default external requests to Google Fonts and Unpkg (for MathJax and iframe-worker). This exposed user IP addresses to third parties without consent.

**Action:**
1.  Modified 'src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/mkdocs.yml.jinja' to:
    *   Enable the 'privacy' plugin (which automatically downloads and bundles external assets).
    *   Remove the 'offline' plugin (which injects external scripts).
    *   Set 'theme.font.text' to 'Inter' (triggering the privacy plugin to download it).
    *   Remove external MathJax script (privacy trade-off documented in comments).
2.  Modified 'src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/overrides/stylesheets/extra.css' to remove the Google Fonts '@import' and use the local 'Inter' font family.
3.  Verified by generating a demo site, building it, and grepping the output for external links (result: none).

**Reflection:**
The 'privacy' plugin in MkDocs Material is a powerful tool for 'Simplicity' and 'Privacy'. It abstracts away the complexity of manual asset management while ensuring compliance. The 'offline' plugin, conversely, introduced hidden complexity and privacy leaks. 'Delete over deprecate' applied perfectly here.
