## Goals
- Review team sprint plans, provide feedback, and create Essentialist sprint plans.

## Execution
## 💎 2026-01-26 - Delete Legacy Migrations

**Observation:**
The `src/egregora/database/migrations.py` file contained a `migrate_media_table` function which was intended to migrate data from a legacy `media` table to the unified `documents` table. As the project has moved to a "V3 Pure" architecture where the `media` table no longer exists (and `init.py` handles fresh installs), this migration code was dead weight. It was also being tested by a dedicated test file `tests/unit/database/test_media_consolidation.py`, adding to the maintenance burden.

**Action:**
1.  Verified via `grep` that `migrate_media_table` was only used in `migrations.py` and the test file.
2.  Deleted `migrate_media_table` and its invocation from `src/egregora/database/migrations.py`.
3.  Deleted `tests/unit/database/test_media_consolidation.py`.
4.  Verified that `tests/unit/database/test_unified_schema_constraints.py` (which uses `migrate_documents_table`) still passes.

**Reflection:**
Deleting code is the highest form of maintenance. By removing this legacy migration, we reduce the surface area for bugs and confusion. Future developers won't have to wonder "What is this media table?". The "Delete over deprecate" heuristic was successfully applied.

## 💎 2026-01-26 - Sprint Planning & Feedback

**Observation:**
The team's sprint plans for Sprint 2 contained several issues: merge conflicts in `steward-plan.md`, Portuguese language in `visionary-plan.md`, and vague objectives in `refactor-plan.md`. Additionally, I confirmed `bolt`'s suspicion of N+1 queries in `windowing.py`.

**Action:**
1.  Created `.team/sprints/sprint-2/essentialist-feedback.md` detailing these findings.
2.  Created `.team/sprints/sprint-2/essentialist-plan.md` focusing on "Delete over deprecate" (completed in this session) and reviewing refactors.
3.  Created `.team/sprints/sprint-3/essentialist-plan.md` focusing on simplifying `EgregoraConfig` ("Meta-config" smell).

**Reflection:**
The planning phase is critical for alignment. By flagging issues like N+1 queries early, we prevent technical debt from accumulating. My feedback to the team emphasizes specificity and adherence to heuristics.
