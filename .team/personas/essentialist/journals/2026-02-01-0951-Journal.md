## Goals
- Identify and eliminate one architectural smell to reduce maintenance load.

## Execution
**Observation:** The architecture analysis highlighted 'Inconsistent Error Handling' in the write pipeline, where some errors were fatal while others were silently ignored or logged inconsistently. **Action:** I implemented the  pattern. 1) Created  with  protocol and . 2) Updated  to hold the boundary. 3) Injected  in . 4) Refactored  to use the boundary for commands, writer, profile, enrichment, and journal operations. 5) Added comprehensive unit tests. **Reflection:** This aligns with 'One good path over many'. Instead of ad-hoc try/except blocks, we now have a centralized policy for what is FATAL vs WARN. This makes the system more predictable and robust.
