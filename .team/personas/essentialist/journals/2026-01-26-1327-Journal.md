## Goals
- Fix plans, optimize windowing, feedback

## Execution
Observation: Found corrupted steward-plan.md (merge conflicts) and Portuguese visionary-plan.md. Also identified N+1 query pattern in _window_by_count. Action: Fixed plan files. Refactored _window_by_count to use 'Fetch-then-Compute' optimization (O(1) queries). Created Sprint 2/3 plans and feedback focusing on 'Simplicity Watchdog' role. Reflection: 'Fetch-then-Compute' is the preferred pattern for this stack. Plan corruption suggests a need for stricter merge checks.
