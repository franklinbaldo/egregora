## Goals
- Reduce maintenance load

## Execution

## 💎 2026-02-01 - Decompose EnrichmentWorker

**Observation:**
The  in  was a monolithic class (650+ lines) handling orchestration, URL enrichment, Media enrichment, file staging, and persistence. This violated 'Small modules over clever modules' and made testing and maintenance difficult. Several  TODOs explicitly requested its decomposition.

**Action:**
1.  Refactored  into a package .
2.  Created  for the main  orchestrator.
3.  Created  () and  () to encapsulate domain-specific logic.
4.  Created  and  for shared definitions and utilities.
5.  Updated  to maintain the public API (Facade pattern).
6.  Updated unit tests () to reflect the new structure and patch the correct targets.

**Reflection:**
The refactoring significantly improves code organization. Handlers are now focused on their specific domains. The  acts as a true orchestrator/mediator. Tests required significant updates due to heavy use of mocking internal structures, highlighting the coupling that was present. Future work could further decouple handlers from the worker instance by passing only required context.
