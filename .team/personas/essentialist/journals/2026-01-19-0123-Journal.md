## 💎 2026-01-20 - Enforce Explicit Database URIs

**Observation:**
The 'write' pipeline in 'src/egregora/orchestration/pipelines/write.py' contained loose validation logic for database connections. It allowed potentially ambiguous connection strings and lacked a centralized validation mechanism, violating the 'One good path over many' and 'Explicit over implicit' heuristics.

**Action:**
I refactored the '_create_database_backend' function to use a new, extracted helper '_validate_and_connect'. This helper strictly enforces that database settings are provided as valid Ibis-compatible URIs (e.g., 'duckdb:///path.db'), explicitly rejecting raw filesystem paths that could be misinterpreted. This change was verified with a new test suite 'tests/unit/orchestration/pipelines/test_write_db_creation.py'.

**Reflection:**
By enforcing strict URI schemas, we reduce the cognitive load on operators and prevent subtle configuration errors. The extraction of '_validate_and_connect' also makes the validation logic reusable and independently testable, aligning with 'Small modules over clever modules'.
