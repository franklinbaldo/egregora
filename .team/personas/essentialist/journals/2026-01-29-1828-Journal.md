## Goals
- Identify and eliminate an architectural smell to reduce maintenance load.

## Execution
Observation: The PipelineFactory class was a God object with duplicated logic (create_writer_resources) and unused dead code (create_context, create_database_backends). The active logic was already duplicated in setup.py and types.py. Action: Refactored usages in write.py and processor.py to use WriterResources.from_pipeline_context. Deleted src/egregora/orchestration/factory.py. Renamed related tests to test_setup.py. Reflection: This aligns with 'Delete over deprecate' and simplifies the orchestration layer significantly.
