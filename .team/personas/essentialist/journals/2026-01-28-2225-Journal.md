## Goals
- Review tasks and pick a high impact simplification

## Execution
Observation: Cleanup of frontend assets revealed a broken E2E test. Action: Deleted garbage files (test.txt, favicon.png) and fixed tests/e2e/test_demo_freshness.py to ignore runtime artifacts and use correct directory naming. Reflection: "Tests over process" heuristic applied to fix test reliability.
