## Goals
- Review sprint plans, provide feedback, create my plans, and remove one legacy artifact.

## Execution
Observation: Identified legacy aliases in RAG module and process deviations in sprint plans. Action: Removed 'get_embedding_router' and 'index_documents' aliases, updated all call sites and tests. Fixed pre-existing ruff N806 error. Provided feedback on sprint plans. Reflection: Codebase hygiene is improving, but process discipline (language, plan existence) needs monitoring.
