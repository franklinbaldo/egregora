## Goals
- Remove legacy code and complete sprint planning

## Execution

**Observation:** The codebase contained a legacy CSS file (`docs/stylesheets/extra.css`) that was shadowing the modern "Portal" theme overrides (`src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/overrides/stylesheets/extra.css`). This was explicitly blocking the visual rollout of the new design. The root `mkdocs.yml` also referenced this file.

**Action:**
- Deleted `docs/stylesheets/extra.css`.
- Removed the `extra_css` reference from `mkdocs.yml` to prevent build warnings.
- Updated sprint plans for Sprint 2 and Sprint 3 to reflect the current state and focus on cleaning up legacy media handling and input hacks.
- Provided feedback to other personas (Steward, Simplifier, Refactor, Maya) to align on the "Finish and Polish" goal.

**Reflection:** The removal of the "purple gradient" legacy theme is a symbolic and practical step towards the V3 "Portal" vision. My next focus (Sprint 3) will be on the backend, ensuring that our media handling and input adapters are just as modern and clean as the frontend. The "legacy" markers in the code are dwindling, but the hunt continues.
