## Goals
- Plan Sprints 2 & 3, Provide Feedback, and Remove one legacy artifact

## Execution
Observation: Identified 'read_document' in 'src/egregora/output_sinks/base.py' as a backward-compatible alias for 'get'. Verified it was unused. Action: Removed 'read_document'. Also fixed merge conflicts in 'sprint-2/absolutist-plan.md' and created feedback/plans for Sprints 2 & 3. Reflection: The removal was clean. The merge conflict in planning files was a surprise but critical to fix. The codebase is slightly cleaner.
