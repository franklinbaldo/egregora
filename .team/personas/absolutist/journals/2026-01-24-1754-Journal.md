## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution

Observation: The `OutputSink` protocol and its implementations were cluttered with legacy aliases (`read_document` -> `get`) and unused compatibility shims (`list_documents`). Additionally, the helper `derive_mkdocs_paths` was marked for removal but still present.

Action:
- Removed `list_documents` from `OutputSink`, `BaseOutputSink`, and `DbOutputSink`.
- Removed `derive_mkdocs_paths` and updated its only consumer (an E2E test) to use `MkDocsPaths`.
- Renamed `read_document` to `get` across the entire codebase (Protocol, Implementations, Consumers, Mocks, and Tests).
- Fixed a discovered regression in `tests/unit/agents/test_rag_exception_handling.py` where it was importing a function from `write.py` that had moved to `etl/preparation.py`.

Reflection: The codebase is now simpler with a single, unambiguous method (`get`) for retrieving documents. The removal of shims reduces the surface area for bugs and confusion. The broken test I found highlights the value of rigorous verification when touching core protocols.
