## Goals
- Identify and remove one piece of substantiated legacy code

## Execution
Observation: The task '20251231-041918-remove-commented-out-legacy-code.md' for 'write.py' was outdated; the file was already clean. However, I identified and removed legacy aliases '_resolve_host_ips' and '_validate_ip_is_public' from 'src/egregora/security/ssrf.py'. Action: Removed aliases and refactored 'tests/security/test_ssrf.py' to use the public API directly. Reflection: This reinforces the need to verify 'legacy' claims in tasks before assuming work is needed, and provided an opportunity to improve test hygiene.
