## Goals
- Remove one piece of legacy code and create sprint plans

## Execution
Observation: Identified  in  as a legacy compatibility shim, contradicting a memory that claimed it was already removed. Action: Refactored  to use  directly, then deleted  and the unused  compatibility method. Reflection: This reinforces that the codebase state supersedes memory. I also completed sprint planning tasks for Sprints 2 and 3.
