## Goals
- Identify and remove one piece of substantiated legacy code.

## Execution
Observation: The `migrate_media_table` function in `src/egregora/database/migrations.py` was marked as removed in comments but the code persisted. It was only used by a test file explicitly testing this legacy function. Action: Removed `migrate_media_table` and deleted `tests/unit/database/test_media_consolidation.py`. Reflection: The codebase is cleaner. The legacy "media" table concept is further erased, enforcing the "documents" table as the single source of truth.
