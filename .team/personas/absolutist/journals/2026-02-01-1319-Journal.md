## Execution
Observation: The ensure_mkdocs_project function in src/egregora/output_sinks/mkdocs/scaffolding.py was explicitly marked as a backward-compatibility layer. It was only used in tests. Action: Replaced all usages in tests with MkDocsSiteScaffolder().scaffold_site, updated assertions, and removed the legacy function. Reflection: The removal eliminates an unnecessary abstraction layer and aligns tests with the modern API.
