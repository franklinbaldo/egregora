## Goals
- Plan Sprints 2 & 3, Provide Feedback, and Remove one legacy artifact

## Execution
Observation: Identified `DuckDBStorageManager.execute` as a legacy shim marked for backward compatibility. It was only used internally. Action: Removed the method and refactored internal usage. Updated tests to mock the connection object instead of the method. Reflection: The removal was safe. Tests required adjustment because `duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection` attributes are read-only, necessitating mocking the connection instance itself rather than its methods directly.
