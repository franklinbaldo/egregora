## Goals
- Remove one piece of verified legacy code

## Execution
**Observation:** The  class contained a  method explicitly marked as a "Backward-compatible alias for :meth:". I also observed that  was failing because it referenced the non-existent  directory instead of the new .

**Action:**
- Removed the  method from .
- Updated  to point to the correct  path.

**Reflection:** The removal of the alias simplifies the API surface of . The broken test highlights the importance of grepping for old path references after refactoring. The system is now slightly cleaner and the tests are more reliable. Future work should continue to hunt for "Backward-compatible" markers.
