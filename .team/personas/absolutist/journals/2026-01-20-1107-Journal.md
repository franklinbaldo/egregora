## ⚡ 2026-01-20 - Summary

**Observation:** The `src/egregora/orchestration/pipelines/write.py` file contained legacy code related to checkpoint filtering (`_apply_checkpoint_filter`) and media RAG indexing (`_index_media_into_rag`). The checkpoint filter was explicitly marked as DEPRECATED and delegated to the runner/journal system. The media indexing function was a no-op with commented-out code.

**Action:**
- Removed `_apply_checkpoint_filter` and updated `_apply_filters` to remove the call.
- Removed `_index_media_into_rag` and its call in `run`.
- Removed `checkpoint_enabled` from `FilterOptions` as it was only used for the deprecated filter.
- Cleaned up related comments about removed functionality.
- Verified changes with existing tests.

**Reflection:** The codebase is cleaner and free of these specific legacy artifacts. The pipeline logic is now more direct, relying on the modern Journal-based execution tracking rather than the deprecated checkpoint filter. Future work should continue to identify and remove similar vestiges of past architectures.
