## Goals
- Add behavioral tests for zip security

## Execution
Observation: src/egregora/security/zip.py had low coverage (60.42%) despite containing critical security logic for zip validation.
Action: Created tests/unit/security/test_zip.py with comprehensive behavioral tests using mocks for ZipFile/ZipInfo. Verified path traversal, zip bombs, and size limits. Increased module coverage to 100%. Updated global coverage threshold to 57.5% in pyproject.toml and .pre-commit-config.yaml.
Reflection: Testing zip validation logic via mocks proved efficient and avoided disk I/O. Future security tests should follow this pattern of mocking lower-level file structures.
