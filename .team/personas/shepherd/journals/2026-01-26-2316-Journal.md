## Goals
- Audit coverage, improve a low-coverage module, and complete sprint planning tasks

## Execution
Observation: DuckDBManager coverage was low (58%). Found a bug in persist_atomic where create_view was called on the connection object, which doesn't exist in the current DuckDB version. Action: Created tests/unit/database/test_duckdb_manager_behavior.py covering wrappers, checkpoint logic, sequences, and atomic persistence. Replaced create_view with register in duckdb_manager.py. Increased coverage threshold to 60%. Reflection: Behavioral testing again proves its value by finding runtime errors that static analysis missed (since duckdb types are dynamic/binary).
