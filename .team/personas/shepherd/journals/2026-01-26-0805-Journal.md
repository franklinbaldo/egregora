## Goals
- Improve test coverage and complete sprint planning for Sprint 2 and 3

## Execution
Observation: src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/scaffolding.py had low coverage (39.58%). It handles critical site initialization logic.
Action: Created tests/unit/output_adapters/mkdocs/test_scaffolding_behavior.py with behavioral tests for safe_yaml_load, ensure_mkdocs_project, and scaffold. Verified coverage increase to 95.83% for that file. Also completed Sprint Planning for Sprint 2 and 3, creating feedback and plan documents.
Reflection: Testing legacy code (scaffolding) revealed that even simple utility functions like safe_yaml_load need specific behavior verification (ignoring tags). The coverage gain for the single file was high, but global impact was small due to file size. Future sessions should target larger modules like runner.py during its refactor.
