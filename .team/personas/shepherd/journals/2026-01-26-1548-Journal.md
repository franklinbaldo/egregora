## Goals
- Complete Sprint 2 & 3 planning and improve coverage for a selected low-coverage module

## Execution
Observation: Coverage for DuckDBStorageManager was low (46%), and tests were purely mock-based. Found bugs in duckdb_manager.py (missing create_view, logic error in replace_rows). Action: Created tests/unit/database/test_duckdb_manager_behavior.py with 8 behavioral tests using a real temporary database. Fixed bugs in DuckDBStorageManager (replaced create_view with register). Increased file coverage to 87.5% and global threshold to 60.0%. Completed Sprint 2 & 3 planning. Reflection: Behavioral tests are critical for database layers where mocks can hide API mismatches (like create_view vs register).
