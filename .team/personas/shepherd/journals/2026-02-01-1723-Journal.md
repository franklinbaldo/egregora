## Goals
- Audit coverage, identify a low-coverage module, and add behavioral tests to increase coverage by 2-4%.

## Execution
Observation: src/egregora/transformations/windowing.py had low coverage (19.74%) and relied on BDD feature files that lacked implementation.
Action: Created tests/unit/transformations/test_windowing_behavior.py with 13 behavioral tests covering count, time, and byte-based windowing strategies, as well as splitting and edge cases. Verified specific behaviors like overlap_ratio=0.2 default and byte-windowing ignoring the first message size.
Reflection: The module coverage increased to ~85.84%. I should investigate why coverage collection failed in the first run (likely import/environment issues). Next sessions should address other low coverage modules like dns.py.
