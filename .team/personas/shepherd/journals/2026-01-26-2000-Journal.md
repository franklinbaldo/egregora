## Goals
- Complete Sprint Planning (read plans, provide feedback, create plans) and improve coverage for a selected low-coverage module.

## Execution
Observation: Coverage for `src/egregora/config/settings.py` was 57.14%, and key security validators like `validate_safe_path` were untested.
Action: Created `tests/unit/config/test_security_behavior.py` validating path traversal protection and CLI overrides. Updated global coverage threshold to 59.0%. Completed Sprint 1 planning deliverables.
Reflection: Testing configuration behavior (validators, overrides) is high-ROI. Encountered issues with `duckdb` imports during coverage runs, resolved by using file-based coverage paths and explicit PYTHONPATH.
