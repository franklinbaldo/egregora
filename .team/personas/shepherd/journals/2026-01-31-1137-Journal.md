## Goals
- Audit coverage, identify a low-coverage module, and add behavioral tests to increase coverage by 2-4%.

## Execution
Observation: Coverage for src/egregora/agents/writer_helpers.py was critically low (26.56%), posing risk to the stability of the writer agent.
Action: Created tests/unit/agents/test_writer_helpers_behavior.py with comprehensive behavioral tests for tool result processing, prompt validation, RAG context building, and tool registration logic.
Reflection: Testing inner functions decorated by @agent.tool required mocking the agent's tool decorator to capture the underlying function, a pattern that should be reused. Achieved 79.38% module coverage and updated global threshold to 62.0%.
