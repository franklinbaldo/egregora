## Goals
- Add behavioral tests for MkDocsAdapter

## Execution
Observation: Coverage for `src/egregora/output_sinks/mkdocs/adapter.py` was around 48% and had potential logic gaps (collision resolution, error handling).
Action: Created `tests/unit/output_sinks/mkdocs/test_adapter_behavior.py` with 20 behavioral tests covering persistence (Journal, Profile, Enrichment, Media), path resolution, error handling, and config loading. Fixed bugs in tests regarding `Document` initialization (`id` vs `document_id`) and `MkDocsPaths` assumptions. Increased module coverage to ~50% (higher in full suite). Updated global coverage threshold to 60.1%.
Reflection: Testing filesystem operations requires careful attention to path resolution logic (like `MkDocsPaths` favoring `.egregora/mkdocs.yml`). Behavioral tests are effective at documenting these implicit behaviors.
