## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: Coverage for `src/egregora/output_sinks/mkdocs/site_generator.py` was 53.64%. The logic for `get_recent_posts` and `get_top_posts_by_elo` had significant gaps, particularly in handling invalid dates and integration with EloStore. Found a bug where `EloStore` was imported from a non-existent module.
Action: Created `tests/unit/output_sinks/mkdocs/test_site_generator_behavior.py` with behavioral tests. Mocked `EloStore` and `DuckDBStorageManager`. Fixed the import path for `EloStore` in `site_generator.py`. Increased global coverage threshold to 58.0% (from 57.5%) and verified a ~6% coverage increase in the target module.
Reflection: Testing legacy code often reveals import errors or dead code (if the import was broken, the feature was likely unused or broken in production). Behavioral tests proved effective in catching this without needing to spin up a real database.
