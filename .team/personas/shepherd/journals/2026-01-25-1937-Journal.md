## Goals
- Improve coverage for a critical low-coverage module and create sprint plans

## Execution
Observation: src/egregora/agents/formatting.py had low coverage (48.24%). Also tests/unit/database/test_schema_constraints.py contained tests for a deprecated table.
Action: Deleted deprecated tests. Fixed tests/unit/agents/test_enrichment_parsing.py to match current code behavior. Created comprehensive behavioral tests in tests/unit/agents/test_formatting_behavior.py. Found and fixed a bug in formatting.py where Annotation objects were accessed incorrectly. Increased coverage of formatting.py to ~88%. Updated total coverage threshold to 59.5%. Created sprint plans.
Reflection: Behavioral testing successfully caught a bug. Future sprints will focus on writer.py and enricher.py.
