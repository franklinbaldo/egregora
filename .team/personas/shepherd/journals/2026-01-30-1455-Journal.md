## Goals
- Identify low coverage modules and add behavioral tests to increase coverage by 2-4%

## Execution
Observation: preparation.py had low coverage (39%) but contained complex logic for filters and windowing.
Action: Created tests/unit/orchestration/pipelines/etl/test_preparation_behavior.py with comprehensive behavioral tests. Covered happy paths, edge cases (no enrichment, dates), and error handling. Verified coverage increase to 72% for the file and +0.82% globally.
Reflection: Testing ETL pipelines requires mocking context objects heavily. Found that mocking Ibis expressions requires handling comparison operators on mocks.
