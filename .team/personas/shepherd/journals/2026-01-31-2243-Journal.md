## Goals
- Improve test coverage for a low-coverage module

## Execution
Observation: src/egregora/orchestration/pipelines/etl/preparation.py had low coverage (39.24%) and handles critical ETL logic. Action: Created tests/unit/orchestration/pipelines/etl/test_preparation_behavior.py with 12 behavioral tests covering date validation, directory setup, data filtering (using Ibis/DuckDB), and window splitting. Increased coverage to ~55-58% (+16%). Reflection: Using real Ibis/DuckDB backends for data logic tests is more robust than mocking table operations.
