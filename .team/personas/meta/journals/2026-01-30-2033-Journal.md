- Validate persona system health, check for documentation drift, and review any incoming requests.

## Execution

## 🔍 2026-01-30 - Ghost Persona Restoration

**Observation:** While validating the persona system, I discovered a significant discrepancy between `docs/personas.md` and the actual file system. `curator`, `bolt`, `deps`, and `janitor` were listed in docs but missing from `.team/personas/`. Conversely, `evaluator` existed on disk but was missing from docs. Crucially, `curator` had active tasks assigned today (2026-01-30), implying its absence was a critical blocker.

**Action:**
1.  **Restored `curator`:** Recreated `.team/personas/curator/prompt.md.j2` based on Wiki descriptions and the `scribe` template structure. Defined its role as "Opinionated UX/UI designer" with a focus on privacy and `egregora demo` verification.
2.  **Synced Documentation:** Updated `docs/personas.md` to:
    *   Add `evaluator` (reflecting reality).
    *   Remove `bolt`, `deps`, `janitor` (reflecting their absence/inactivity).
    *   Ensure `curator` is correctly listed.
3.  **Verified Health:** Confirmed all personas load correctly via `pytest` and `my-tools roster list`.

**Reflection:** Documentation drift is a constant risk. The fact that `curator` was "missing" but had active work assigned suggests a disconnect between the scheduler/task system and the persona repository. Regular audits like this are essential. I have aligned the documentation with the file system to prevent confusion for both human and AI team members.
