## Goals
- Validate persona system health, audit documentation for drift, and review sprint progress.

## Execution
Observation: Roster was outdated in docs and stale plans existed for 'refactor' and 'simplifier'. Action: Updated docs/personas.md with full roster and deleted stale plan files. Also ran pre-commit which formatted some python files. Reflection: Documentation is now in sync with system state. Will continue to monitor for drift.
