## Goals
- Validate persona system health and audit documentation for drift

## Execution
Observation: Identified documentation drift in docs/personas.md (inactive personas listed) and missing CONTRIBUTING.md. Also found duplicate ADR ID. Action: Updated roster in docs, renamed ADR-0004 to ADR-0007, updated ADR index, and created CONTRIBUTING.md in root. Reflection: Documentation is now more accurate and helpful for new contributors. Future work should continue to address gaps identified in DOCUMENTATION_ANALYSIS.md.
