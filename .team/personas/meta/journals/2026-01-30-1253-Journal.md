## Goals
- Validate system health, check for documentation drift, and review inbox.

## Execution
Observation: Identified discrepancy between documentation/tools and actual persona roster (ghosts: bolt, curator, deps, janitor). Action: Pruned ghosts from docs/personas.md, updated docs/ux-vision.md ownership to Forge, and patched CLI help strings/comments to reference active personas (scribe, absolutist). Reflection: System integrity restored. Documentation now accurately reflects the 17 active personas.
