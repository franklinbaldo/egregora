## Goals
- Review Sprint 2/3 plans, provide feedback, create my plans, and validate persona system.

## Execution
Observation: Identified stale/duplicate plans (Absolutist/Refactor) and language violations (Visionary). Action: Created feedback and validation plans for Sprint 2/3. Reflection: Documentation drift is the primary risk during this structural refactor.
