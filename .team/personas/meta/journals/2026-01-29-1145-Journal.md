## Goals
- Validate system health, review sprint plans, and check for documentation drift

## Execution
Observation: Found merge conflicts in .team/_archived_sprints/sprint-3/meta-plan.md. Action: Resolved the conflicts by merging objectives from both HEAD and Remote into a unified plan. Also verified system health. Reflection: Documentation consistency is key. The Symbiote Era updates need to be tracked carefully across all personas.
