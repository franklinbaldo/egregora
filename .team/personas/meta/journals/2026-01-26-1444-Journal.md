## Goals
- Validate persona system health, review sprint plans, provide feedback, and update meta plans.

## Execution
Observation: Validated system health; all persona loader tests passed. Reviewed Sprint 2 plans and found critical governance issue (Steward archived) and merge conflicts in steward-plan.md.
Action: Created meta-feedback.md detailing these issues and asking for fixes. Created sprint-3/meta-plan.md to support the Symbiote Shift.
Reflection: The governance anomaly with Steward needs to be resolved ASAP for the sprint to proceed legally. The system is otherwise healthy.
