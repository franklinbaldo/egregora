## Goals
- Validate persona system health and audit documentation

## Execution
Observation: Identified 33 orphaned tasks assigned to deprecated personas (taskmaster, refactor, docs_curator). Action: Reassigned them to active personas: 'artisan' (general refactoring), 'absolutist' (code removal), and 'scribe' (documentation) using a Python script. Verified system health. Reflection: Need to implement a validation check in the future to prevent assignment to missing personas.
