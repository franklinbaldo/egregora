## Goals
- Validate persona system health and improve documentation examples

## Execution
Observation: Identified inaccuracy in docs/personas.md regarding task file format (claimed TOML, actual YAML) and missing documentation for the SITREP feature shown during login. Action: Corrected the documentation to specify YAML frontmatter, added a concrete task file example, and documented the SITREP feature. Reflection: Accurate documentation of system interfaces (like task files) is critical for autonomous agent reliability. The SITREP is a key orientation tool that deserves visibility.
