## Goals
- Review sprint plans and update docs

## Execution
Observation: The sprint planning process for Sprint 2 revealed a breakdown in git hygiene (Steward's merge conflicts) and adherence to language standards (Visionary's Portuguese). Action: I proactively resolved the merge conflicts in steward-plan.md and updated meta-feedback.md to flag these issues critically. I also updated my own plans to reflect this intervention. Reflection: The system needs automated checks for planning files to prevent merge markers and maybe detect non-English content. I should consider adding a pre-commit hook or a Sheriff task for this in the future. For now, manual intervention was necessary to unblock the team.
