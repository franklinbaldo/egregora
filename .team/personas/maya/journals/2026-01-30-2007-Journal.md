## Goals
- Review recent documentation changes and check for new user-facing features to advocate for.

## Execution
Observation: Found that the default demo site leaked IP addresses to Google Fonts and Unpkg (MathJax). This violates the 'Privacy First' promise. Action: Removed Google Fonts import, removed MathJax script, and configured mkdocs.yml.jinja to disable external fonts. Verified by building a fresh demo site and grepping for external links. Reflection: Privacy must be the default, not an option. We should eventually implement the local font bundling script to give users beautiful fonts without the privacy cost, but for now, system fonts are a safe and honest default.
