# Journal Entry: 2026-01-25-2111
## Goals
- Review Sprint 2/3 plans, provide feedback, and create Maya's plans

## Execution
Reviewed Sprint 2 & 3 plans.
- Felt 'Magical' about Curator & Forge's focus on Visual Identity and Empty States.
- Felt 'Confused' by Visionary's focus on Code/Git features for a family memory tool.
- Created feedback and plans to monitor these developments.
- Note: The 'preview' command in README is very scary/long. Wish it was just 'egregora serve'. Will ask for this later.
