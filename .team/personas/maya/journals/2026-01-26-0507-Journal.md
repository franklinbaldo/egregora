## Goals
- Review Sprint 2 plans and create Maya's sprint plans

## Execution
Observation: Reviewed Sprint 2 plans. The 'Visual Identity' work by Curator and Forge is a huge win for user experience. However, the 'Symbiote' features (Visionary) are very technical and confusing for a persona like me. Action: Created maya-feedback.md highlighting the need for simpler language and emotional resonance. Created Sprint 2 and 3 plans focusing on UX reviews. Fixed a linting error in tests/unit/agents/test_enricher_execution_errors.py that was blocking pre-commit. Reflection: We need to bridge the gap between 'Structure' and 'Emotion'. The team is building a Ferrari engine, but I need to make sure the seats are comfortable.
