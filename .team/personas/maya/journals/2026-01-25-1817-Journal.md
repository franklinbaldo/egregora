## Goals
- Review recent UX changes (About Page, Empty State, Feeds) and documentation for user-friendliness

## Execution
# Maya's Review: Egregora Documentation & Default Experience

## 💝 What Works (Magical Moments)
- **The Core Promise**: The README clearly promises "Stories that remember" and "Loving portraits". This is exactly what I want!
- **Zero Configuration**: The repeated assurance that "Sensible defaults work for 95% of users" gives me confidence.
- **Empty State**: The empty state on the homepage is helpful because it tells me exactly what command to run next.
- **Privacy Focus**: Knowing it runs locally is a huge relief. "Your conversations never leave your computer" is a key selling point for me.

## 😕 What's Confusing (Lost Moments)
- **Technical Jargon in "About" Page**: The default `about.md` page (which my family would see!) talks about "collective consciousness", "LLM editorial control", and "UUID5 pseudonyms". It sounds like a science experiment, not a family album.
- **Scary Installation**: The `uv tool install git+https...` command looks intimidating. "Git" and "plus" and "https" all mixed together?
- **"Win Rate" for Memories**: The "Top Posts" section shows an "ELO" score and "Win rate". It feels weird to rate my dad's funeral memories as having a "high win rate".
- **Complicated Preview**: The `uv tool run ... mkdocs serve` command is huge! I'm afraid I'll type it wrong.

## 💡 Suggestions

### 1. Simplify the User-Facing "About" Page
**Current**: "Egregora is a system that transforms WhatsApp conversations into analytical blog posts... identifying emerging narratives."
**Suggested**: "This blog tells the story of our conversations. It uses AI to weave our chat history into a connected narrative, preserving our memories exactly as they happened."

### 2. Rename "ELO/Win Rate" to "Relevance" or "Impact"
**Observation**: "Win rate" implies competition.
**Action**: Change the UI labels.
**Suggestion**: Use "Resonance", "Impact Score", or just hidden sorting without exposing the numbers.

### 3. Simplify the Quick Start Commands
**Observation**: `uv tool install git+...` is hard to read.
**Action**: Create a simple alias or wrapper script?
**Suggestion**: Can we just say "Download and run the installer"? (I know that's harder for you devs, but it's what I want).

### 4. Humanize the "Anonymization" explanation
**Current**: "All names converted to UUID5 pseudonyms"
**Suggested**: "Names are privately replaced with codes so the AI never sees your real identity."

## ⭐ Overall Impression
I'm excited about the *result* (the blog), but the *process* still feels like I'm hacking into a mainframe. The generated site needs to feel warmer and less "engineered" for my family to enjoy it.
