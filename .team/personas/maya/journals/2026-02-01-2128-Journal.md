## Goals
- Review the 'Connection Health Report' (RFC 041) to ensure it feels supportive and non-technical.

## Execution
Observation: Reviewed RFC 041 and found technical/negative terms ('Ghost List', 'Decay'). Action: Created a visual mock (docs/rfcs/041-mock-maya.md) and updated the RFC to use 'Connection Keepers' and 'Reconnect Opportunities'. Reflection: Catching tone issues at the RFC stage prevents building features that feel cold or judgmental. 'Connection Keepers' is now aligned with the 'Magical' value proposition.
