## Goals
- Review documentation and recent changes for non-technical user friendliness

## Execution
Observation: Documentation was too technical. Action: Created Glossary, simplified Quickstart for non-technical users, and added friendly redirects. Reflection: The 'First Hour' experience is now much less intimidating. We are successfully hiding the complexity of the engine behind a friendly dashboard.
