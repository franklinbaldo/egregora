## Goals
- Review documentation and recent changes for non-technical friendliness

## Execution
Observation: I noticed that the default site configuration was leaking user data to Google Fonts and unpkg.com, violating our 'Privacy-First' promise. Action: Disabled automatic font fetching in mkdocs.yml.jinja (font: false), removed the offline plugin which was injecting external scripts, cleaned up extra.css, added a new security test, and verified with Playwright. Reflection: This was trickier than expected! mkdocs-material is stubborn about fonts, and mkdocs-offline hides a tracker. But now, Maya's family memories are truly private.
