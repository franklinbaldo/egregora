## Goals
- Review the 'First Hour' experience and documentation for non-technical users

## Execution
Observation: Reviewed documentation from Maya's perspective. Found 'About' page good, but 'README' and 'Quickstart' intimidating. Action: Created docs/faq.md, added it to navigation, simplified README installation instructions, hid legacy upgrade notes, and fixed numbering/jargon in Quickstart. Reflection: Documentation is the first interface. Simplifying it makes the product feel more magical and less like a tool. The 'First Hour' experience is now smoother.
