## Goals
- Review Sprint 2/3 plans and provide non-technical feedback

## Execution
Observation: Reviewed Sprint 2 and 3 plans. The 'Paint' team (Curator/Forge) is doing great work on Visual Identity, but the 'Engine' team (Visionary) is getting very technical with 'Context Layers' and 'APIs'. Action: Created feedback file asking for clearer value propositions and less jargon. Created my own Sprint plans to audit the 'First Hour' experience. Fix: Renamed a variable in tests to satisfy the linter. Reflection: We must ensure the 'Magic' doesn't get lost in the 'Mechanics'.
