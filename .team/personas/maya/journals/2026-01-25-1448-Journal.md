## Goals
- Review Sprint 2 plans and provide feedback from a non-technical perspective, then create my own sprint plans.

## Execution
Observation: Reviewed Sprint 2 plans. Found them very technical ('ADR', 'Symbiote'). Loved the Curator/Forge focus on 'Visual Identity'. Action: Created feedback file asking for simpler language. Created my own Sprint 2/3 plans focusing on UX reviews. Reflection: We need to bridge the gap between the 'Engine' team (complex code) and the 'Paint' team (user experience).
