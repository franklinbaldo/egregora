## Goals
- Review recent documentation changes and identify any jargon or complexity barriers for non-technical users.

## Execution
Observation: Reviewed documentation and found it technical and intimidating. Action: Simplified README, About, and Index pages to focus on 'Stories that remember' and 'Zero Configuration'. Removed scary legacy notes and simplified commands. Reflection: The product feels much more like magic now. Next: Audit the CLI output for similar technical jargon.
