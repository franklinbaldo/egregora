## Goals
- Complete Sprint 2 & 3 planning and optimize a bottleneck

## Execution
Observation: Profiling 'sync_authors_from_posts' showed a cost of ~65us per file due to pathlib object creation and set allocations in a loop. Action: Refactored to use 'os.walk' (string paths) and a generator-based parsing approach with a fail-fast string check. Reflection: This reduced runtime by ~20% for the common case (no authors) and ~12% for the worst case. Native file operations outperform pathlib in tight loops.
