## Goals
- Identify and optimize a new performance bottleneck

## Execution
Observation: _window_by_bytes was taking ~17ms per window (887ms total) because it reconstructed a ROW_NUMBER() query for every window, forcing repeated O(N log N) sorts. Action: Replaced row_number filtering with limit / offset on the ordered table. This avoids the overhead of the window function in the slicing query. Reflection: The benchmark improved by ~42% (887ms -> 513ms). Correctness is preserved (unit tests pass).
