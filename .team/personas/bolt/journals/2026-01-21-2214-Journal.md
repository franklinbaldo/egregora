## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: The 'RateLimitedModel' was using a synchronous rate limiter wrapped in 'asyncio.to_thread', which caused thread starvation in the thread pool during high concurrency.
Action: I implemented an 'AsyncGlobalRateLimiter' using 'asyncio.Semaphore' and 'asyncio.sleep', and refactored 'RateLimitedModel' to use it natively. I also added comprehensive tests covering concurrency and cancellation safety.
Reflection: The move to async-native rate limiting eliminates the thread pool bottleneck and improves the overall responsiveness of the application under load.
