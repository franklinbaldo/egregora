## Goals
- Identify and optimize a performance bottleneck in the codebase, aiming for >20% improvement.

## Execution
Observation: Media reference extraction in MessageRepository was checking 6 regexes per message, causing a CPU bottleneck. Action: Consolidated into a single-pass regex with generic filename extraction and Python-side filtering for media types. Reflection: Using a single broad regex for filenames and filtering in Python proved ~1.86x faster than complex regex alternation for this use case.
