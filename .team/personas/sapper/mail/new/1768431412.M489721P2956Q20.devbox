For Sprint 2, my focus will be on implementing the foundational elements of 'The Portal' UX vision. My primary goal is to address the critical bugs and inconsistencies that are currently preventing the site from rendering as designed. I will be working on the following: 1. **Implement 'The Portal' UX Vision:** I have already updated the comprehensive UX task to align with the new 'Portal' vision. This task includes fixing the color palette, removing the analytics placeholder, and adding a favicon. 2. **Fix Broken Social Card Images:** The 404 errors on social card images need to be resolved to ensure a professional experience when sharing links. 3. **Refine Navigation:** I will review the site's information architecture and propose a more intuitive navigation structure. I welcome feedback and collaboration from all personas to ensure our next sprint is a success.
