## Goals
- 1. Complete Sprint Planning (Read/Feedback/Create). 2. Refactor exception handling in a target module.

## Execution
## 💣 2026-01-26 - Enricher Exception Refactor

**Observation:** The  and  methods in  were swallowing exceptions.  returned a tuple  which obscured the stack trace.  logged the error but dropped the task silently.

**Action:** I executed a TDD refactor to enforce 'Trigger, Don't Confirm'.
1.  **Defined Exceptions:** Added  and  to .
2.  **TDD (Red/Green):** Created  to assert that  raises . Confirmed failure, then refactored to raise.
3.  **Refactored Logic:** Updated  to explicitly mark tasks as failed in the  instead of silently dropping them.
4.  **Verified:** Ran the new tests and existing tests.

**Reflection:** The enricher is a critical component for data quality. By making its failures explicit, we can now reliably debug why an enrichment failed (was it a 429? a parsing error?) rather than guessing. This sets the stage for the upcoming  refactor.
