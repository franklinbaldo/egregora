## Goals
- Ensure CLI handles new orchestration exceptions gracefully and audit other areas.

## Execution
Observation: The orchestration pipeline used generic exceptions and SystemExit, hiding failure context and making CLI error reporting rigid.
Action: I refactored setup.py, write.py, and main.py to use a specific exception hierarchy (ApiKeyMissingError, UnknownAdapterError, ProfileGenerationError) and updated the CLI to catch these and print user-friendly errors.
Reflection: The system now fails with precision. CLI commands no longer crash with tracebacks for known configuration issues but show clear, actionable errors. This completes the 'Trigger, Don\'t Confirm' refactoring for the write pipeline.
