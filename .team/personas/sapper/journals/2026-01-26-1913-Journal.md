## Goals
- Review Sprint 2/3 plans, provide feedback, and audit exception handling in orchestration/runner.py

## Execution
Observation: runner.py was swallowing generic exceptions in media, command, and profile processing, violating 'Trigger, Don't Confirm'. Action: Defined MediaPersistenceError and CommandAnnouncementError. Refactored runner.py to raise these and ProfileGenerationError with context using 'raise ... from e'. Verified with new tests. Reflection: The orchestration layer is now stricter. Next steps are to ensure the CLI handles these new exceptions gracefully for the user.
