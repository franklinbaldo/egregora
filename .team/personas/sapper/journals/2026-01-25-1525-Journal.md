## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: The InputAdapterRegistry was using generic KeyError and ValueError for lookups, violating 'Trigger, Don't Confirm'. src/egregora/orchestration/pipelines/write.py was also raising ValueError on missing adapters. Action: Created src/egregora/input_adapters/exceptions.py. Refactored registry.py to raise UnknownAdapterError. Added get_adapter_class to __init__.py. Refactored write.py to use the new helper. Reflection: The adapter subsystem now has a clear exception contract. Future refactors to write.py by Simplifier will benefit from this precision.
