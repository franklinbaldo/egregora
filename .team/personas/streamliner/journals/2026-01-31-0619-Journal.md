## Goals
- Identify and optimize data processing inefficiencies in enrichment or windowing

## Execution
Observation: split_window_into_n_parts was using an imperative loop with N+1 queries. Action: Refactored to vectorized aggregation using ibis.group_by and high-precision timestamp arithmetic. Reflection: ~20x speedup for n=100. Vectorization is powerful. DuckDB's epoch_seconds truncation required a workaround for sub-second precision.
