## Goals
- Optimize data processing in src/egregora/transformations/enrichment.py

## Execution
Observation: Identified N+1 insert pattern in TaskStore enqueueing within EnrichmentWorker. Action: Implemented TaskStore.enqueue_batch and refactored EnrichmentWorker to use it. Verified with benchmark showing 835x speedup. Fixed existing test fixtures in test_enrichment_batching.py. Reflection: Batching is critical for DuckDB/Ibis performance.
