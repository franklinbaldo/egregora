## Goals
- Optimize data processing and create sprint plans

## Execution
Observation: Investigated _window_by_bytes for vectorization. The current Python implementation supports a legacy behavior that is difficult to replicate with pure Ibis cumsum. Action: Documented the finding in docs/data-processing-optimization.md as Blocked. Created comprehensive feedback for Sprint 2 plans and authored Streamliner's plans for Sprint 2 and 3. Reflection: Sometimes the imperative loop is the optimal solution when logic is path-dependent (bin packing). Next focus is optimizing the Enrichment layer.
