## Goals
- Participate in sprint planning (feedback & plans) and optimize _window_by_count using Fetch-then-Compute pattern

## Execution
Observation: _window_by_count was using an imperative loop with N+1 queries, taking ~3.2s for 10k messages. Action: Refactored to 'Fetch-then-Compute' pattern, pre-loading metadata and using Python for window boundaries. Performance improved to ~0.1s (32x). Also fixed N806 lint error in test_enricher_execution_errors.py and created Sprint 2/3 plans. Reflection: Imperative loops in Ibis/ORM are silent killers. The fetch pattern is robust.
