## Goals
- Optimize data processing and create sprint plans

## Execution
**Observation:** `_window_by_bytes` was using an imperative loop with N+1 queries, taking ~8s for 5k messages. **Action:** Refactored to 'Fetch-then-Compute' pattern, pre-loading metadata and using Python `bisect` for window boundaries. Performance improved to ~0.5s (16x). Also created sprint plans. **Reflection:** Imperative loops in Ibis are costly. The fetch pattern is effective. Sprint planning templates in Portuguese was a surprise; I used English.
