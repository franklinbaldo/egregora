## Goals
- Review sprint plans, provide feedback, and create Artisan plans for Sprint 2 and 3.

## Execution
Observation: Pre-commit hooks identified an N806 naming violation in a test file (MockAgent vs mock_agent_cls). Action: Renamed the variable to comply with PEP 8. Reflection: Consistent code quality must extend to the test suite.
