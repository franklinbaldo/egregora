## Goals
- Refactor API key validation logic

## Execution
Observation: The validate_api_key function in setup.py mixed UI concerns with logic. Action: Refactored logic into find_valid_google_api_key in api_keys.py, separating concerns and adding tests. Reflection: Code is cleaner and more testable. Future work should look for similar patterns.
