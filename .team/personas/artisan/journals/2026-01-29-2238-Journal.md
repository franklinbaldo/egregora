## Goals
- Identify and refactor a complex function or improve typing in a core module

## Execution
**Observation:** The `Enricher` module was using bare `dict` type hints for task data, obscuring the expected structure (JSON-like). Additionally, `Writer` contained dead code for legacy `tool-return` handling that conflicted with modern `pydantic-ai` types.

**Action:** Refactored `Enricher` methods (`_enrich_single_url`, `_execute_url_*`, etc.) to use `dict[str, Any]`. Removed the unreachable legacy fallback in `Writer`.

**Reflection:** Strict typing in agent orchestration is critical as payloads are often dynamic. Removing dead code paths prevents confusion during type checking and reduces cognitive load.
