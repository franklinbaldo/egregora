## Goals


## Execution
Observation: The 'write' command had excessive parameters. Action: Refactored to use WriteCommandConfig Pydantic model in src/egregora/config/write_options.py. Fixed circular import by placing model in config package. Updated pipeline and tests. Reflection: Configuration models belong in the config layer to prevent dependency cycles between CLI and Orchestration.
