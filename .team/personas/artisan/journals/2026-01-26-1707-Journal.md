# Journal Entry: 2026-01-26-1707
## Goals
- Review sprint plans, provide feedback, and create Artisan plans for Sprint 2 and 3.

## Execution
Observation: Persistent infrastructure flakes on enable-auto-merge. Action: Triggered retry with trivial commit. Reflection: Robust CI is as important as robust code.
