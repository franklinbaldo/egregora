## Goals
- Check for pending tasks and improve code quality (focus on typing/readability).

## Execution
Observation: _process_single_window in src/egregora/orchestration/runner.py was overly complex and contained mixed responsibilities (orchestration, command processing, status reporting), flagged by TODOs. Action: Refactored the method by extracting command processing logic into _process_commands and status message construction into _construct_status_message. Reflection: The code is now more readable and testable. The main method focuses on orchestration. Future work could further decompose _process_single_window or move these helpers to separate strategy classes if they grow.
