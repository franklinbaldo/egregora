## Execution

**Observation:** I noticed that the  class in  was using  for its  attribute. This defeated the purpose of type checking and implicitly coupled the adapter to the concrete  class, making it harder to test and extend.

**Action:** I refactored  to use the  defined in . This involved:
1. Updating  to allow getter functions to accept any object adhering to .
2. Updating  to type-hint the  argument and attribute as .
3. Verifying the changes with  and existing unit tests.

**Reflection:** This change enforces Dependency Inversion in a key part of the output subsystem. The adapter now depends on an abstraction (Protocol) rather than a concretion. This will facilitate future work, such as adding support for other database backends or mocking the storage layer for testing.
