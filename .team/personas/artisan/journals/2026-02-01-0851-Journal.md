## Goals
- Check for tasks and improve code quality

## Execution
Observation: The call_with_rotation method in ModelKeyRotator used a complex while True loop with multiple continue statements to manage state transitions between keys and models. This made the logic hard to follow. Action: Refactored the method to use explicit nested loops: an outer loop for models and an inner loop for keys. This clarifies the fallback strategy (try all keys for Model A, then switch to Model B). I verified the behavior with existing unit tests. Reflection: The code is now more readable and less prone to logic errors during future maintenance. The delegation to GeminiKeyRotator remains but the orchestration is clearer.
