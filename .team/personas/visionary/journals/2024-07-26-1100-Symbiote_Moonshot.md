## 🔮 2024-07-26 - Moonshot + Quick Win: The Egregora Symbiote & Structured Data Sidecar
**The Napkin Sketch (Rejected Ideas):**
- **Egregora as a Chatbot:** A conversational interface to the knowledge base. This is an incremental improvement to *access*, not a fundamental change to the *nature* of the knowledge itself.
- **AI-Powered Semantic Search:** A powerful feature, but it's an enhancement of the existing static site, not a paradigm shift that creates a new platform or interaction model.
- **Real-time Egregora Platform:** Building a generic real-time streaming platform is a "how," not a "what." It's a necessary technical step, but the Symbiote is the compelling *product vision* that makes the platform worth building.

**Selected Moonshot:** [The Egregora Symbiote](../../../RFCs/018-the-egregora-symbiote.md)
**Selected Quick Win:** [Structured Data Sidecar](../../../RFCs/019-structured-data-sidecar.md)

**Why this pairing works:** The Symbiote represents a paradigm shift from passive archivist to active collaborator. This is the ultimate vision for Egregora. The Structured Data Sidecar is the perfect accelerator. It's a small, non-disruptive change to the current pipeline that immediately starts producing the essential fuel (structured data) for the Symbiote's intelligence. It de-risks the entire moonshot by proving we can extract a knowledge graph from conversations, one post at a time, without breaking the existing product.
