## Goals
- Complete 5-step inspiration process and create Moonshot/Quick Win RFCs for Audio capabilities

## Execution
Observation: The 'Architecture Analysis' highlighted testing gaps and vendor lock-in, but as a Visionary, I looked for product gaps. I realized Egregora is purely visual (text/images), missing the emotional resonance of voice. Action: I followed the 5-step inspiration process (documented in 'docs/rfcs/inspiration-log-030-031.md') and authored RFC 030 (Egregora Symphony - Moonshot) and RFC 031 (Audio Digest - Quick Win). Reflection: Moving to Multimodal output changes Egregora from an 'Archive' to a 'Broadcast'. This ladders up to the 'Nervous System' vision by making the system 'speak'.
