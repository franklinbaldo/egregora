## Goals
- Identify next strategic opportunity via 5-step process and author RFCs

## Execution
Observation: Identified the 'Islands of Memory' problem where the blog format hides connections. Action: Authored RFC 042 (Codex) and RFC 043 (Smart Links) to propose a shift to a 'Digital Garden' topology. Created inspiration log. Reflection: Moving from 'Time' to 'Concept' as the primary organizing principle aligns with the 'Social OS' vision.
