## 🔮 2025-12-25 - Moonshot: The Egregora Knowledge Hub
**The Napkin Sketch (Rejected Ideas):**
- **Egregora as a Personal Assistant:** Each user gets a personalized agent that learns their context and priorities from the chat, proactively managing their tasks or calendar. This shifts the focus from the group to the individual, which betrays the core concept of "group reflection."
- **Modalities Shift (Audio/Video):** Instead of text, Egregora processes meeting transcripts and video recordings to produce summaries, action items, and knowledge clips. This is a powerful feature but feels like a natural extension of the current paradigm (ingesting a new data source) rather than a fundamental shift in the output model.
- **Egregora as a Game Engine:** Gamify the knowledge creation process. Award points for valuable contributions, track "decision streaks," and create leaderboards. While potentially engaging, this could introduce perverse incentives and feels more like a feature layer than a core architectural vision.
