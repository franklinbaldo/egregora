## 🔮 2025-12-31 - Moonshot + Quick Win: Egregora the Scribe & Real-Time Framework
**The Napkin Sketch (Rejected Ideas):**
- **Egregora the Facilitator:** An agent that actively moderates, @-mentions users, and calls votes. This is a great "next step" after the Scribe, but is too complex for the initial Moonshot. It requires a much deeper understanding of social dynamics.
- **Egregora as a Tool-User:** Allowing the agent to interact with external systems like GitHub or Notion. Powerful, but it moves the focus away from the core value proposition of improving the conversation itself.
- **The Ambient Egregora:** A version of Egregora that modifies the chat UI directly. This is the ultimate endgame, but it's a total paradigm shift that would require a custom client, making it too far out.

**Selected Moonshot:** [Egregora the Scribe](../../../RFCs/010-egregora-the-scribe.md)
**Selected Quick Win:** [Real-Time Adapter Framework](../../../RFCs/011-real-time-adapter-framework.md)

**Why this pairing works:** The Scribe represents a fundamental shift from passive analysis to active participation. It's a tangible, high-value expression of a real-time Egregora. The Real-Time Adapter Framework is the absolute prerequisite for this vision. It's the non-negotiable first step, de-risking the entire concept by focusing on the core technical challenge: breaking free from batch processing. By building the framework first, we pave the way for the Scribe and all future real-time agents.
