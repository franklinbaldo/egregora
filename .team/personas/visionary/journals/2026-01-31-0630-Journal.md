## Goals
- Complete the 5-step inspiration process to identify a new Moonshot and Quick Win opportunity, resulting in two new RFCs.

## Execution
Observation: I identified a key friction point: Egregora is an archive of *text*, but users want an archive of *facts*. The current 'fuzzy' RAG approach fails to answer precise questions. Action: I followed the 5-step inspiration process and authored RFC 034 (The Semantic Loom - Moonshot) to propose a Knowledge Graph architecture, and RFC 035 (The Entity Extractor - Quick Win) to provide immediate value and data cleaning capabilities. Reflection: Moving from 'Text' to 'Knowledge' is the critical step to enabling the 2031 vision of a 'Digital Twin'. The Quick Win is a safe, low-risk step towards that ambitious goal.
