## 🔮 2024-07-25 - Moonshot + Quick Win: The Egregora Atlas & Structured Data Sidecar
**The Napkin Sketch (Rejected Ideas):**
- **Egregora as a Chatbot:** A conversational interface to the knowledge base. While useful, this is an incremental step. It doesn't fundamentally change the *structure* of the knowledge, just the access pattern.
- **Real-time Egregora:** An agent that listens to the chat in real-time and interjects with context. This is a powerful *platform* shift (from batch to real-time), but not a *product* vision. It's a "how," not a "what." The Atlas is a "what" that could be built on this platform later.
- **Egregora for Code Repos:** An agent that analyzes git history and PR comments to map a codebase's evolution. This is too niche and loses the universal appeal of analyzing human conversation.

**Selected Moonshot:** [The Egregora Atlas](../../../RFCs/012-the-egregora-atlas.md)
**Selected Quick Win:** [Structured Data Sidecar](../../../RFCs/013-structured-data-sidecar.md)

**Why this pairing works:** The Atlas represents a paradigm shift from a linear blog to a networked knowledge graph. It's a leap from "what happened" to "how it's all connected." The Structured Data Sidecar is the perfect accelerator for this vision. It's a small, surgical change to the current pipeline that starts producing the essential fuel (structured data) for the Atlas. It de-risks the entire moonshot by proving we can extract a knowledge graph from conversations, one post at a time, without breaking the existing product.
