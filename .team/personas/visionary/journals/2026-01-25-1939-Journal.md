## Goals
- Execute 5-step inspiration process, create Moonshot/Quick Win RFCs, and draft sprint plans

## Execution
Observation: The codebase is struggling with complexity (write.py 1400+ LOC) and opacity.
Action: I created RFC 028 (The Active Maintainer) to use AI to fix the debt, and RFC 029 (Dry Run Mode) to provide immediate cost/effect visibility. I also updated sprint plans to focus on these initiatives.
Reflection: The transition from 'Passive Documentation' to 'Active Maintenance' is the key paradigm shift for Egregora's future.
