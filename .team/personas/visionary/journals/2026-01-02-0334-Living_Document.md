## 🔮 2026-01-02 - Moonshot + Quick Win: The Living Document & Pseudonymous Sidecar
**The Napkin Sketch (Rejected Ideas):**
- **Egregora as a Chatbot:** A conversational interface to the knowledge base. This is an incremental improvement to the *access* of knowledge, not a fundamental change to the *nature* of the knowledge itself. The Living Document is a change in nature.
- **Visual Egregora (Knowledge Graph):** While powerful, a visual graph is still a passive, retrospective output. It doesn't create the feedback loop that allows the AI to learn and collaborate.
- **Proactive Agent in Chat:** An agent that interjects in real-time. This is a huge leap in interaction, but it's a feature built on a foundation of understanding. The Living Document is the mechanism by which the agent *gains* that deeper understanding through human guidance.

**Selected Moonshot:** [The Living Document](../../../../RFCs/014-the-living-document.md)
**Selected Quick Win:** [Pseudonymous Sidecar](../../../../RFCs/015-pseudonymous-sidecar.md)

**Why this pairing works:** The Living Document transforms Egregora from a passive archivist into an active collaborator. This is impossible without the agent being able to understand feedback, which requires knowing who said what. The Pseudonymous Sidecar is the key that unlocks this. It breaks the rigid assumption of total anonymity and introduces attribution in a safe, privacy-preserving way. This small, surgical quick win is the non-negotiable first step to building a truly symbiotic AI.
