## Goals
- Submit RFCs

## Execution
Observation: Identified critical vendor lock-in and static limitations. Action: Created Moonshot RFC 032 (Egregora Live) and Quick Win RFC 033 (Universal Gateway). Documented full inspiration process. Reflection: The shift to a local server paradigm (Moonshot) is ambitious but necessary for the 'Digital Twin' vision. The Universal Gateway (Quick Win) is the immediate enabler for privacy and resilience.
