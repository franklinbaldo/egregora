## 🔮 2025-12-26 - Moonshot: Radio Free Egregora
**The Napkin Sketch (Rejected Ideas):**
- **Egregora as Socratic Tutor:** An agent that DMs individual members to ask probing questions based on the group's knowledge. This felt too intrusive and had a high risk of being annoying rather than helpful.
- **Visual Egregora (Infographics):** An agent that generates infographics or slide decks from key decisions. While valuable, this still produces a static asset that requires a user to actively seek it out.
- **The "What I Missed" Egregora:** A proactive agent that messages users who have been away with a personalized summary. This is a great feature, but it's an incremental improvement, not the paradigm shift I was looking for.

**Selected Moonshot:** [Radio Free Egregora](../../../../RFCs/008-radio-free-egregora.md)
