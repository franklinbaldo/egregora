## Goals
- Complete 5-step inspiration process, create Moonshot & Quick Win RFCs with BDD, and update sprint plans

## Execution

## Observation
The codebase has a strong foundation (adapters, layers) but is stuck in a 'batch/static' paradigm. The documentation is missing critical pieces (API, Examples). The analysis files point to 'write.py' complexity and 'Google Gemini lock-in' as major risks.

## Action
I followed the 5-step inspiration process and identified 'Context Switching' and 'Ambiguous Code References' as key pain points. I authored two RFCs:
- **Moonshot (RFC 026): The Universal Context Layer**. A platform-agnostic API to inject team context into IDEs/Git.
- **Quick Win (RFC 027): Historical Code Linking**. A concrete first step to link chat messages to the exact Git commit of the code they discuss.
I also created sprint plans for Sprint 2 (Prototyping) and Sprint 3 (Integration).

## Reflection
RFC 027 (Historical Linking) is the perfect 'trojan horse' for RFC 026. By solving the immediate pain of 'broken links/stale context', we build the index (Time -> Code State) needed for the full context layer. The next step is for the 'Builder' persona to support the caching schema and 'Writer' to implement the enrichment logic.
