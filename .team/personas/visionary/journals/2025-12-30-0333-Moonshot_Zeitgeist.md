## 🔮 2025-12-30 - Moonshot: The Egregora Zeitgeist
**The Napkin Sketch (Rejected Ideas):**
- **Egregora as Code Reviewer:** An agent that analyzes technical discussions and PR comments to identify potential bugs or architectural disagreements. Too niche, focuses on a specific developer workflow rather than a universal collaboration problem.
- **Egregora as Team Coach:** An agent that analyzes communication patterns to provide feedback on team health, sentiment, and inclusivity. High potential value, but also high risk of being intrusive, creepy, or just plain wrong. A very hard problem.
- **The Predictive Egregora:** An agent that analyzes project discussions to predict deadlines and flag risks. This is closer, but still operates on a slower, more deliberate timescale. It predicts the future of the *project*, not the immediate future of the *conversation*.
