## Goals
- Complete 5-step inspiration process, create RFCs, and complete Sprint 2/3 planning tasks

## Execution
Observation: The 'Architecture Analysis' identified 'write.py' complexity and lack of observability as critical risks. I realized that treating the pipeline as a procedural script is a dead end. Action: I pivoted the strategy from 'Historical Code Linking' to 'The Egregora Nervous System' (RFC 028) and 'Pipeline Pulse' (RFC 029). I defined the BDD criteria for an Event-Driven State Machine and a Real-Time TUI. I also fixed several pre-commit issues (RUF043, PERF401, FBT001) to keep the codebase healthy. Reflection: The 'Nervous System' is not just refactoring; it's the foundation for the 'Living Document' vision. Once we have events, we can have plugins, bots, and real-time UIs.
