## Goals
- Complete 5-step inspiration process, create Moonshot & Quick Win RFCs, and update sprint plans

## Execution
Observation: The 'System Feedback' section in the Writer's journal is currently a dead end—insights are generated but not acted upon. Action: I authored RFC 028 (Egregora Autopoiesis) to propose a self-rewriting system, and RFC 029 (Reflective Prompt Optimization) as a concrete Quick Win to automate the feedback loop. Reflection: This shift from 'static tool' to 'living system' introduces new risks (Prompt Injection -> System Mutation), which I've flagged for Sentinel. The next step is to define the feedback schema in Sprint 2.
