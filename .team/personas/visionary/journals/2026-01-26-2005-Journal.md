## Goals
- Complete 5-step inspiration process, create Moonshot & Quick Win RFCs, and complete Sprint 2 & 3 planning tasks

## Execution
Observation: The architecture is overly monolithic and isolated. I identified that while we have 'Batch' capabilities, we lack 'Federation' and 'Real-time' connectivity.
Action: I authored Moonshot RFC 028 (Egregora Mesh) to propose a decentralized federation protocol, and Quick Win RFC 029 (Cross-Site Reference Resolver) to validate the concept with a simple 'smart embed' system. I also updated the Sprint plans to reflect this shift from 'Local' to 'Connected'.
Reflection: The 'Mesh' concept fundamentally challenges the 'Island' assumption of the current architecture. This will require significant changes to the 'Steward' (Governance) and 'Sentinel' (Security) domains in future sprints.
