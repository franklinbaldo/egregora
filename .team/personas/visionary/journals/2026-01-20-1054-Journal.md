- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
# Continuity Journal — 2026-01-14

## Observation
The codebase is heavily focused on refactoring (V3) and technical debt. While necessary, this creates a vacuum for user-facing innovation. I also noticed that while we have advanced 'under the hood' capabilities like LanceDB (RAG) and ELO ranking, they are largely invisible to the end user, who still sees a static, linear blog.

## Action
I conducted the 5-step inspiration process and identified a key opportunity to transform the 'linear blog' into a 'spatial knowledge graph'. I authored two RFCs:
- **Moonshot (RFC 024): The Egregora Atlas**. A vision for an interactive, explorable 3D/2D map of the group's mind.
- **Quick Win (RFC 025): Semantic Constellation Widget**. A concrete first step that adds AI-explained 'related posts' to the footer, proving we can use embeddings for navigation.

I also fixed a minor linting issue in 'tests/step_defs/test_reader_steps.py' to keep the build green.

## Reflection
The 'Constellation Widget' is a perfect bridge. It doesn't require a massive frontend rewrite (unlike the full Atlas) but immediately changes the user experience from 'chronological' to 'associative'. If successful, it validates the data for the full Atlas.

## System Feedback / TODOs
- [ ] The 'EnricherAgent' should be expanded to not just summarize URLs but to actively suggest internal links between posts.
- [ ] We need to standardize how 'embeddings' are exposed to the frontend. Currently, they are locked in LanceDB/DuckDB. We need a build-time step to export a 'graph.json' or similar for client-side visualization.
- [ ] 'ruff' is very strict about duplicate functions in BDD tests; we should ensure new scenarios don't copy-paste existing step definitions without renaming.
