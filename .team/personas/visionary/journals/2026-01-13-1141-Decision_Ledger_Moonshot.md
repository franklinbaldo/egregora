## 🔮 2026-01-13 - Moonshot + Quick Win: The Decision Ledger & Decision Extraction Enrichment
**The Napkin Sketch (Rejected Ideas):**
- **Egregora as a Project Manager:** A full-fledged project management tool with boards, tickets, and burndown charts. This is too complex and competes with established tools. The value is in *extracting* the plan from the conversation, not in building another Trello.
- **Sentiment Analysis Dashboard:** A visual dashboard of team morale and sentiment over time. While interesting, it's a passive analytical tool and doesn't directly drive action or accountability.
- **Egregora for Legal:** An agent trained to identify contractual commitments and risks in conversations. This is too niche and high-stakes for the core product.

**Selected Moonshot:** [The Decision Ledger](../../../../docs/rfcs/020-the-decision-ledger.md)
**Selected Quick Win:** [Decision Extraction Enrichment](../../../../docs/rfcs/021-decision-extraction-enrichment.md)

**Why this pairing works:** The Decision Ledger represents a fundamental shift in Egregora's value proposition from a passive archivist to an active source of truth for execution. It directly addresses the "friction" of translating talk into action. The Decision Extraction Enrichment is the perfect first step. It leverages the existing architecture to immediately deliver the core value—surfacing decisions and actions—directly to the user in a familiar format. This allows us to perfect the most critical and difficult part of the vision (the AI extraction logic) while delivering immediate user value, perfectly de-risking the larger moonshot.
