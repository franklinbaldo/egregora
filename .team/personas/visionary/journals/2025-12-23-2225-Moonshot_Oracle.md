## 🔮 2025-12-23 - Moonshot: The Egregora Oracle
**The Napkin Sketch (Rejected Ideas):**
- **Egregora as Simulator:** Use chat logs to model and predict team dynamics and project outcomes. Too academic, not enough direct user value.
- **Voice-First Egregora:** Ingest voice notes/meetings and produce a summary podcast. Still reactive, doesn't change the core loop.
- **The Onboarding Egregora:** Auto-generate a "welcome packet" for new chat members. High value, but an incremental feature, not a paradigm shift.
- **Egregora Knowledge Graph:** Transform the blog into a visual, explorable graph of concepts and decisions. Powerful, but too complex; the Oracle delivers this value more directly in-chat.

**Selected Moonshot:** [The Egregora Oracle](../../../../RFCs/005-the-egregora-oracle.md)
