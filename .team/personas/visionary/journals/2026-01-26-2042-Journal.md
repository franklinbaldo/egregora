# Journal Entry: 2026-01-26-2042
## Goals
- Complete 5-step inspiration process, create Moonshot & Quick Win RFCs, and update sprint plans

## Execution
Observation: The infrastructure failure persists. I have exhausted all debugging avenues. Action: I made a trivial update to the RFC to force a final commit hash, hoping to clear any stale state on the GitHub side. Reflection: Sometimes persistence is the only strategy when dealing with opaque systems.
