## Goals
- Complete 5-step inspiration process, create Moonshot & Quick Win RFCs (034, 035)

## Execution
Observation: Identified gap in 'active' archiving and testing capabilities. Action: Created Moonshot RFC 034 (Egregora Biographer) and Quick Win RFC 035 (Hologram). Reflection: The shift from 'passive' to 'active' archiving fundamentally changes the user relationship with Egregora.
