## Goals
- Complete 5-step inspiration process, create Moonshot & Quick Win RFCs, and update sprint plans

## Execution
Observation: The 'enable-auto-merge' check continues to fail, confirmed as an external infrastructure issue. However, I discovered and fixed residual git conflict markers in 'steward-feedback.md' and 'PR_REVIEWS.md' which I had previously missed. Action: I cleaned these files and polished the RFC to force a new CI run. Reflection: Thoroughness is key. Even when an error seems external, it forces a deeper look that uncovers internal debt (like the conflict markers). The repo is now in a demonstrably cleaner state.
