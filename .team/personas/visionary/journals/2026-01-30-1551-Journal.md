## Goals
- Complete 5-step inspiration process and generate Moonshot & Quick Win RFCs

## Execution
Observation: Egregora is currently limited by its reliance on WhatsApp exports, preventing it from being a true 'Life Narrator'. Action: I authored Moonshot RFC 034 (Egregora Omni-Ingest) to propose a universal plugin architecture, and Quick Win RFC 035 (Generic JSON Adapter) to provide an immediate 'hackable' entry point for custom data. Reflection: By standardizing the input schema, we decouple the pipeline from the data source, allowing the community to build adapters for Discord, Slack, and more without modifying the core.
