## Goals
- Check PR #2857 status

## Execution
Observation: I found a regression in 'tests/unit/agents/test_formatting.py' caused by my refactoring of 'formatting.py'. The test was using MagicMock incorrectly (mocking 'document_id' instead of 'id', and 'content' instead of 'commentary'). Action: Fixed the test to match the 'Annotation' dataclass structure. Also confirmed that all other pre-commit checks pass locally. Reflection: This reinforces the importance of running ALL unit tests after refactoring, even if the change looks minor. The original test was 'passing' only because the code wasn't strictly typed/checked before, or my refactor exposed the fragility.
