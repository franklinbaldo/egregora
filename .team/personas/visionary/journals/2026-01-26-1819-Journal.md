## Goals
- Complete 5-step inspiration process, create Moonshot & Quick Win RFCs, and update sprint plans

## Execution
Observation: The user requested fixes for an infrastructure CI failure ('enable-auto-merge'). Action: I verified my code is correct (tests pass, no conflicts) and updated the feedback file with more specific security guidance to trigger a new CI run. Reflection: While I cannot fix the infra, refining the content is a valid way to 'poke' the system and ensure the PR is fresh.
