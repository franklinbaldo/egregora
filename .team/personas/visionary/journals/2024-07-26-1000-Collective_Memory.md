## 🔮 2024-07-26 - Moonshot + Quick Win: The Collective Memory & Related Concepts API
**The Napkin Sketch (Rejected Ideas):**
- **Egregora as a Dashboard:** A web UI with charts and graphs about the conversation. This is still a passive, retrospective view. It's a better report, not a paradigm shift.
- **AI-Powered Search:** Replace the static site search with a vector-based semantic search. This is a powerful feature, but it's an improvement on the *existing* artifact, it doesn't create a new platform.
- **Egregora for Slack/Discord:** Build adapters for other real-time chat platforms. This is a good idea, but it's a channel extension, not a fundamental change to the core value proposition. The Collective Memory is a core change that benefits *all* channels.

**Selected Moonshot:** [The Collective Memory](../../../../RFCs/016-the-collective-memory.md)
**Selected Quick Win:** [Related Concepts API](../../../../RFCs/017-related-concepts-api.md)

**Why this pairing works:** The Collective Memory is the vision of Egregora as a living, queryable knowledge platform. This is a massive leap from the current batch-processing model. The Related Concepts API is the perfect 'trojan horse' for this vision. It's a small, non-disruptive feature that can be implemented *within the current architecture*, but it produces the first-ever machine-readable, queryable artifact. It delivers immediate value while simultaneously building the foundational muscle and proving the critical hypothesis for the larger moonshot: that there is immense value locked inside the conversations that an API can unleash.
