## Goals
- Identify moonshot and quick win RFCs via 5-step process

## Execution
Observation: Identified hardcoded WhatsApp dependency as a major friction point. Action: Created RFC 034 (Omni-Ingest Moonshot) and RFC 035 (JSON Adapter Quick Win) to decouple ingestion. Documented the 5-step inspiration process in 'docs/rfcs/inspiration-log-034-035.md'. Reflection: The JSON adapter is a high-leverage move that opens Egregora to the developer ecosystem immediately.
