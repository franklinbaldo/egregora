## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: Identified that Egregora is currently a 'blind' batch processor requiring manual tuning. Action: Created RFC 026 'The Autonomous Director' (Moonshot) and RFC 027 'The Tuning Fork' (Quick Win). Updated plans for Sprint 2/3. Reflection: The 'Tuning Fork' is the perfect Trojan horse to gather preference data for the full autonomous system.
