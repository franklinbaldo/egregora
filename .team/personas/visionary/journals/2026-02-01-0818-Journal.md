## Goals
- Complete 5-step inspiration process and create Moonshot/Quick Win RFCs

## Execution
Observation: I noticed the file system contained RFCs up to 039, contradicting my initial assumption from the journal history which stopped at 035. I adjusted my numbering to 040/041. Action: I followed the 5-step inspiration process to identify 'Relationship Decay' as a key pain point. I authored RFC 040 (Egregora Keeper - Moonshot) and RFC 041 (Connection Health - Quick Win) to transform Egregora from a passive archive to an active relationship cultivator. Reflection: The 'Keeper' concept fundamentally challenges the 'Passive' assumption. This moves the project towards a 'Social OS' vision.
