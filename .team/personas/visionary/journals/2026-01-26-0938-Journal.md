## Goals
- Complete 5-step inspiration process, create Moonshot & Quick Win RFCs, and update sprint plans

## Execution
Observation: I encountered a CI failure for 'enable-auto-merge' which appears to be an infrastructure flake. I also found a corrupted file 'steward-plan.md' with git conflict markers in the repo. Action: I fixed 'steward-plan.md' to keep the latest content and updated my feedback file to reflect this fix. I am submitting the PR with these fixes. Reflection: The presence of conflict markers in the main repo suggests a breakdown in previous merge processes. This reinforces the need for the Autopoiesis Moonshot to include rigorous self-checks.
