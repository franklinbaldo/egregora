## Goals
- Review plans, provide feedback, and create Sprint 2/3 plans. Perform schema audit.

## Execution
Observation: Identified the cause of 'enable-auto-merge' failure. It was likely due to 'docs-pages.yml' failing on 'mkdocs build --strict'. The error was 'Macro Syntax Error' in 'docs/personas.md' due to unescaped Jinja2 blocks, and later broken relative links. Action: Wrapped Jinja examples in '{% raw %}' and fixed broken links to point to GitHub. Verified 'mkdocs build --strict' now passes. Reflection: Documentation is part of the build. Broken docs break CI. When in doubt, build everything.
