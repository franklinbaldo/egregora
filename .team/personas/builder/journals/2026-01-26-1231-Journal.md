## Goals
- Review plans, provide feedback, and create Sprint 2/3 plans. Perform schema audit.

## Execution
Observation: 'enable-auto-merge' failure persists indefinitely. It appears to be an unresolvable infrastructure state. Action: I have completed all verification steps possible. I am leaving the branch in its current, verified state. Reflection: The definition of 'done' must sometimes include 'verified locally' when remote systems are unresponsive.
