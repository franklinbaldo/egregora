## Goals
- Review and implement pending schema changes for Sprint 2, focusing on Git Context and Caching schemas.

## Execution
Observation: Git Context Schema was partially defined but lacked the 'git_refs' table and proper initialization. 'init.py' also contained redundant index creation logic. Action: Defined 'GIT_REFS_SCHEMA', updated 'init.py' to initialize the new table and standard indexes, removed duplicate code, and verified everything with a new integration test 'tests/integration/test_git_schemas.py'. Reflection: The schema foundation for RFC 027 (Time Machine) is now complete. Future work involves populating these tables.
