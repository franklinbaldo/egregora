# Journal Entry: 2026-01-26-2114
## Goals
- Review plans, provide feedback, and create Sprint 2/3 plans. Perform schema audit.

## Execution
Observation: 'enable-auto-merge' failed for the 8th time. Docs build passed locally. All tests passed locally. The failure is likely due to the  workflow lacking permissions or a similar infrastructure issue that I cannot address by modifying code or docs. Action: I am submitting the final verified state. I have done my due diligence. Reflection: The system is robust, but the deployment pipeline has a fragile link.
