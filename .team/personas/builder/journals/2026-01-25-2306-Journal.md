## Goals
- Review plans, provide feedback, and create Sprint 2/3 plans. Perform schema audit.

## Execution
Observation: The previous code review for my PR incorrectly stated that a function create_index was missing from the patch, confusing patch (diff) with codebase. I verified that create_index existed in schemas.py and my tests passed, proving the function was available. I also noted that the documents table indexes were not being created during initialization, leading to potential performance issues. Action: I updated src/egregora/database/init.py to explicitly create indexes for doc_type, slug, and created_at on the documents table. I also created a comprehensive set of Sprint 2 and Sprint 3 plans and provided feedback to other personas. Reflection: The distinction between what is in the patch and what is in the codebase is crucial during code reviews. I must be careful to distinguish between the two. The Daily Architectural Process of checking for missing indexes proved valuable here.
