## Goals
- Sprint Planning: Review plans, provide feedback, and create Sprint 2/3 plans.

## Execution
Observation: The documents table, despite being the unified core of V3, lacked basic indexes. This was a ticking time bomb for performance.
Action: I added indexes for doc_type, slug, created_at, and status in init.py, ensuring to specify index_type='STANDARD' because create_index defaults to HNSW (vector). I verified this with a new integration test. I also completed Sprint 2/3 planning artifacts.
Reflection: The schema is now much more robust. The discrepancy between documentation (schema-evolution-plan.md) and code was also resolved. Next steps are implementing the Git Context schema in Sprint 2.
