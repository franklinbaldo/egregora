## Goals
- Review plans, provide feedback, and create Sprint 2/3 plans. Perform schema audit.

## Execution
Observation: Received feedback about 'enable-auto-merge' failure. Investigated code and confirmed 'create_index' exists in 'schemas.py'. Pre-commit hooks reformatted 'src/egregora/agents/enricher.py'. Action: Verified 'tests/integration/test_db_indexes.py' passes. Confirmed code integrity. Reflection: The CI failure seems unrelated to code correctness, likely an infrastructure glitch or permission issue. The code is solid.
