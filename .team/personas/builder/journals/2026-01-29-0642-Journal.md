## Goals
- Review Sprint 2 schema requirements and implement any pending schema changes

## Execution
Observation: Found duplicate and conflicting Elo schema definitions in schemas.py vs elo_store.py, and ad-hoc table creation in EloStore. Action: Consolidated Elo schemas into schemas.py, added explicit initialization with indexes in init.py, refactored EloStore to use these, and added comprehensive integration tests. Reflection: The database initialization is now more robust and centralized, aligning with 'Structure Before Scale'. Tests verify correct schema application.
