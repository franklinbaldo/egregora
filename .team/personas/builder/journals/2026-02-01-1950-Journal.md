## Goals
- Review schema status, check inbox, and implement any pending Sprint 2 schema changes or refinements.

## Execution
Observation: Identified that 'create_table_if_not_exists' in 'schemas.py' was ignoring 'nullable=False' constraints from Ibis schemas, allowing invalid NULL data in 'created_at' and 'source_checksum'. Action: Patched 'create_table_if_not_exists' to enforce NOT NULL SQL generation and updated 'BASE_COLUMNS' to strictly require these fields. Updated comprehensive regression tests in 'tests/unit/database' and 'tests/integration' to supply valid data. Reflection: The schema foundation is now strictly typed and constrained, preventing invalid states at the database level as per 'Structure Before Scale'.
