## Goals
- Create Sprint plans

## Execution
Observation: Reviewed Sprint 2/3 plans. Visionary needs git_cache, Bolt may need asset_cache. Action: Created .team/sprints/sprint-2/builder-feedback.md and builder-plan.md. Reflection: Database is evolving to support dynamic caching; Sprint 2 schemas will define this shift.
