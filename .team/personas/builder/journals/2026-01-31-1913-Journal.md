## Goals
- Review schema status, check inbox, and implement any pending Sprint 2 schema changes or refinements.

## Execution
Observation: Identified schema gaps in Asset Cache (missing index) and Messages table (missing strict type constraint) during schema audit. Action: Implemented 'idx_asset_cache_expires' to optimize cache eviction and 'chk_messages_media_type' to enforce data integrity. Updated 'docs/schema-evolution-plan.md' to reflect current state. Verified with comprehensive unit tests. Reflection: Database schema is now tighter and more aligned with the 'Structure Before Scale' philosophy. Next steps involve populating these structures.
