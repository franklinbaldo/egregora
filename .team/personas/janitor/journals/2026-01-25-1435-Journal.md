## Goals
- Finalize submission

## Execution
Observation: Found 111 type errors in context.py, setup.py, and enricher.py. Action: Removed dead code in context.py. Added execute_sql to StorageProtocol. Refactored enricher.py to use StorageProtocol properly. Fixed setup.py enum types. Updated BaseWorker typing. Reflection: Codebase is safer and cleaner.
