**Observation:** Mypy reported 164 type errors in . A significant cluster involved incorrect type assumptions in  and , specifically regarding the return type of  (assumed tuple, actually dict) and  (handling  return type in sync contexts). Additionally,  instantiation in  incorrectly passed a list of dictionaries instead of  DTOs.

**Action:**
- Modified  to correctly unpack the dictionary returned by  using , fixing a runtime .
- Added  to  and  to handle the  return type of , resolving Mypy errors.
- Updated  to convert raw message dictionaries into  DTOs before passing them to , ensuring type safety.
- Updated  to use  Enums for safety settings, replacing deprecated string literals.
- Updated unit test  to match the corrected logic (mocking dictionary return instead of tuple).

**Reflection:** The  return type mismatch was a critical bug that would have caused runtime failures. This highlights the value of static type checking in catching integration issues between modules. The conversion to DTOs in  aligns the pipeline implementation with the strict typing defined in . Future sessions should continue to chip away at the remaining ~140 Mypy errors, perhaps focusing on the  module next.
