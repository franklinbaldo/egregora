## 🧹 2025-12-30 - Summary

**Observation:** The `vulture` dead code detector reported an unused parameter `posts_created` in the `finalize_window` method across several `OutputSink` implementations and an unused `DbOutputSink` import in `src/egregora/orchestration/materializer.py`.

**Action:**
- Added a new unit test, `test_finalize_window_runs_without_error`, to `tests/unit/output_sinks/test_base.py` to ensure the method's behavior was covered before making changes.
- Modified the `finalize_window` method signature in the `OutputSink` protocol (`src/egregora/data_primitives/document.py`) and all concrete implementations (`BaseOutputSink`, `DbOutputSink`, `MkDocsAdapter`), prefixing the unused argument with an underscore (`_posts_created`) to signify it is intentionally unused.
- Corrected a pre-existing test in `tests/unit/test_output_sink_protocol.py` that failed due to the signature change.
- In `src/egregora/orchestration/materializer.py`, replaced the unused `DbOutputSink` import with the more generic `OutputSink` protocol for the type hint, improving code modularity.
- Verified the fix by running `vulture` again and confirming the warnings were resolved.

**Reflection:** The initial `vulture` scan was effective. The TDD approach of adding a test first prevented regressions. The widespread test failures after the initial change were a surprise, but they highlighted the importance of checking for existing tests that might be affected by a refactoring. The fix in the materializer to use the `OutputSink` protocol was a good opportunity to improve the code's design. For the next session, I will focus on a `mypy` scan to improve type safety.
