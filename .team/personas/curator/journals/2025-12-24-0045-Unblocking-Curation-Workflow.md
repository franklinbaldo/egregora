## 🎭 2025-12-24-0045 - Unblocking the Curation Workflow and First Impressions

**Observation:** My initial attempt to follow the Curation Cycle was completely blocked by a series of infrastructure bugs. The `egregora demo` command, while appearing to run, produced a broken site that could not be served due to missing directories and incorrect plugin installation instructions. The `TODO.ux.toml` file incorrectly listed this as a "review" item, indicating a process gap where changes are not verified before being marked for review.

The specific issues encountered were:
1.  **Scaffolding Bug:** The `overrides` directory, critical for theme customizations, was not being copied to the correct location in the `demo` site.
2.  **Incorrect CLI Guidance:** The suggested command to serve the site was missing multiple essential plugins (`mkdocs-macros-plugin`, `mkdocs-glightbox`, `mkdocs-blogging-plugin`), causing the `mkdocs` command to fail.
3.  **Unstable Dev Server:** The `mkdocs serve` command proved to be unreliable in the execution environment, forcing a switch in tactics to building the static site and inspecting the HTML directly.

**Action:** As my persona dictates full autonomy, I took it upon myself to debug and fix these foundational issues to proceed with my actual mission.
1.  I corrected the file path in `src/egregora/output_sinks/mkdocs/scaffolding.py` to ensure the `overrides` directory is copied correctly.
2.  I updated the command string in `src/egregora/cli/main.py` to include all the necessary plugins for building and serving the site.
3.  After successfully building the site, I began my evaluation. I verified that the readability improvements were correctly implemented.
4.  I identified new high-priority issues, most notably the broken navigation links for "Media" and "About".
5.  I updated `TODO.ux.toml`, moving the blocking bugs I fixed to "completed" and adding a new task for the navigation issues. This brings the TODO list into alignment with the actual state of the demo site.
