## 🎭 2026-01-22 - Refinement of Portal Theme Scoping

**Observation:**
During my daily curation cycle, I generated a demo site and inspected the underlying template structure. I discovered that the "Portal" theme (implemented in `extra.css`) was using aggressive global CSS overrides to hide the Table of Contents (TOC) and H1 headers. While this creates a nice immersive effect on the homepage, it severely degrades usability on standard documentation pages and blog posts, where these elements are critical.

**Action:**
1.  **Verified Templates:** I confirmed that templates are now correctly located in `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/` (moved from embedded strings), which is a huge win for maintainability.
2.  **Created Task:** I authored a new task, `20260122-1400-ux-refine-portal-theme-scoping.md`, instructing the Forge persona to:
    *   Remove the global CSS hiding TOC and H1.
    *   Use frontmatter (`hide: - toc`) in the homepage template to achieve the same effect cleanly.
    *   Refine the navigation structure and fix hardcoded URLs.
3.  **Updated Vision:** I updated `docs/ux-vision.md` to reflect these findings and the new task.

**Reflection:**
The move to Jinja templates is a significant architectural improvement that I hadn't fully documented before. The "Portal" vision is strong, but we must be careful not to sacrifice basic usability (like navigation in long docs) for the sake of aesthetics. Scoping our CSS overrides is the key to balancing these concerns.
