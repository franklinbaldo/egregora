## Goals
- Evaluate current UX state and identify next improvements for the Portal vision

## Execution
Observation: The 'Portal' theme styles (in docs/) were shadowing the layout improvements (in overrides/) because MkDocs prioritizes docs/ content. This led to a site that looked right (colors) but behaved wrong (broken related posts layout).

Action: I cleaned up the task backlog by deleting two obsolete/incorrect tasks. I authored a new, precise task (20260129-ux-fix-css-fragmentation) to merge these files properly. I also updated docs/ux-vision.md to reflect this 'Fragmented' state.

Reflection: Configuration precedence is a silent killer in static site generators. We must be rigorous about where our assets live. The 'Consolidation' effort needs to be atomic and verified.
