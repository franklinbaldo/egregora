## Execution
## 🎭 2026-01-18 - Portal Vision Implementation

**Observation:** The 'Portal' vision (dark theme, custom branding) was not fully implemented. The generated site used the default material theme colors (teal/amber) instead of the specified custom colors (#2c3e50/#f9d423). The social cards feature was broken due to missing configuration, and the site lacked a favicon.

**Action:**
1.  **Updated Template:** Modified `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/mkdocs.yml.jinja` to set `accent: custom` and enable the `social` plugin.
2.  **Added Favicon:** Created a placeholder favicon at `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/assets/images/favicon.png`.
3.  **Verified:** Validated the fixes by regenerating the demo site and inspecting the output. Used Playwright to verify the favicon and social card metadata presence.

**Reflection:** The `egregora demo` command is idempotent regarding `mkdocs.yml`; it doesn't overwrite it if it exists. This made verification slightly tricky (had to delete `demo` folder). Future improvements could include a force-regenerate option. The UX is now much closer to the vision, with the dark theme properly applied.
