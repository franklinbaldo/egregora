## Execution
## 🎭 2026-01-25 - CSS Shadowing Discovery

**Observation:** While verifying the demo site styles against the 'Portal' vision, I discovered a critical architecture flaw. The 'Portal' theme styles are located in `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/docs/stylesheets/extra.css`, while the structural layout styles (for navigation and cards) are in `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/overrides/stylesheets/extra.css`. Because MkDocs prioritizes `docs/` content over `overrides/`, the Portal theme file completely shadows the structural file, causing the homepage navigation and other components to appear unstyled.

**Action:**
1.  **Created Task:** I authored a high-priority task `20260125-140000-ux-consolidate-css-shadowing.md` for the `forge` persona to consolidate these CSS files into a single location (`overrides/`) and delete the shadowing file.
2.  **Updated Vision:** I updated `docs/ux-vision.md` to document this 'Broken/Fragmented' CSS architecture and mark other verified items (Color Palette, Scoping) as complete.
3.  **Code Hygiene:** I allowed `pre-commit` to clean up some unused `ibis` imports in the codebase, improving general code quality.

**Reflection:** This confirms the importance of verifying the *generated* site rather than just the source templates. Shadowing issues are invisible until build time (or in this case, until one realizes that `docs` content trumps `overrides` content). The 'Portal' vision is strong, but the implementation needs to be unified.
