## Goals
- Verify demo site templates and update UX vision

## Execution
Observation: The docs/demo directory was stale, containing legacy custom.css and masking the true state of templates. A fresh build (clean_demo) revealed that custom.css is correctly removed from generation, but privacy violations (Google Fonts, MathJax) persist. Action: Created tasks 20260130-ux-regenerate-demo to cleanup artifacts and 20260130-ux-fix-feeds-links to fix broken absolute links. Updated docs/ux-vision.md with these findings. Reflection: Checked-in generated artifacts are untrustworthy; always verify against a fresh build to see the true state of the codebase.
