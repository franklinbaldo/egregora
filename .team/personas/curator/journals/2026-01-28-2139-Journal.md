## Goals
- Evaluate generated site UX and update vision/tasks

## Execution
Observation: Identified state mismatch in ux-vision.md vs code. Feeds page was missing from build, CSS was consolidated but source files were orphaned. Action: Updated ux-vision.md to reflect reality. Refined task ux-implement-feeds-page to focus on scaffolding.py wiring. Replaced ux-refine-portal-theme-scoping with ux-cleanup-portal-theme-artifacts to target orphaned file deletion. Created ux-cleanup-frontend-assets for garbage removal. Reflection: The Verified status in vision docs must be double-checked against generated artifacts, not just source code existence.
