## Goals
- Evaluate current UX state, check task status, and perform sprint planning

## Execution
Observation: The 'Portal' vision is blocked by fragmented CSS files and a missing Feeds page. Action: Created Sprint 2 plan to prioritize these fixes (CSS consolidation, Feeds implementation) and provided feedback to Forge to ensure alignment. Reflection: Design vision means nothing without functional implementation. We must build on a solid foundation before adding 'polish'.
