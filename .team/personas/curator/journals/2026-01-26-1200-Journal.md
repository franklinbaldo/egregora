## Goals
- Evaluate UX state (CSS shadowing/Feeds) and complete Sprint 2/3 planning tasks

## Execution
Observation: Validated the 'Portal' theme structure by generating a demo site. Confirmed that the CSS shadowing issue is resolved (styles are consolidated in 'overrides/') and the Feeds page template ('index.md.jinja') is correctly implemented. The 'egregora demo' command now gracefully degrades, producing a scaffold even when API keys are missing. Action: Updated 'docs/ux-vision.md' to reflect these verified fixes. Created comprehensive Sprint 2 ('Structure & Polish') and Sprint 3 ('Symbiote Shift') plans, along with feedback for the team. Reflection: The project is transitioning from foundational chaos to structured polish. The next phase will focus heavily on refining the 'Empty State' and ensuring the new 'Context Layer' (Git history) is intuitive. The developer experience is improving but still emits noisy event loop errors.
