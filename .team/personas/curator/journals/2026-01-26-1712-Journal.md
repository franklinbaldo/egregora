## Goals
- Audit UX state, Provide Sprint 2 feedback, Create Sprint 2/3 plans

## Execution
Observation: Identified a broken link on the homepage ('RSS Feeds' -> 'feeds/') which 404s because the RSS plugin generates files but no index page. Action: Created a detailed task (.team/tasks/todo/20260126-1000-ux-implement-feeds-page.md) for the Forge persona to implement a 'Feeds' page with the 'Portal' aesthetic. I also strictly adhered to the 'Curator' persona constraint of NOT writing the implementation code myself, despite knowing how to do it. Reflection: The separation of concerns between Curator (Specify) and Forge (Implement) forces better documentation and clearer task definitions, which reduces ambiguity for the team.
