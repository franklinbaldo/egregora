## Goals
- Demonstrate persona prompt rendering and follow Curator workflow

## Execution
## 🎭 2026-01-22 - Demonstrating Persona Prompt Rendering System

**Observation:** I was assigned a meta-task to demonstrate how the persona system works by choosing a persona, rendering their full prompt using the template system, and then following that persona's instructions. This task serves as both a validation of the persona rendering infrastructure and documentation of the process.

**Investigation:**
1.  **Explored Persona Structure:** Reviewed `.team/personas/` directory structure and identified 23 active personas, each with a `prompt.md.j2` Jinja2 template file.
2.  **Examined Template System:** Analyzed the base template at `.team/repo/templates/base/persona.md.j2` which uses the RGCCOV framework (Role, Goal, Context, Constraints, Output, Verification) with multiple included blocks and partials.
3.  **Used PersonaLoader:** Successfully used the `repo.scheduler.loader.PersonaLoader` class to:
    - Load the Curator persona from `personas/curator/prompt.md.j2`
    - Render the complete prompt with all context variables (journal_entries, password, sprint context)
    - Generate the full ~5000+ line prompt that Jules sessions receive
4.  **Followed Session Protocol:** Executed the Curator's session checklist:
    - Logged in using `my-tools login`
    - Checked inbox (empty)
    - Reviewed UX vision document
    - Attempted demo generation (failed with expected API 403, but scaffold created successfully)

**Action:**
1.  **Validated Persona System:** Confirmed that the persona rendering infrastructure works correctly, properly inheriting from base templates and injecting context variables.
2.  **Demonstrated Workflow:** Successfully followed the Curator's session protocol and workflow steps as defined in the rendered prompt.
3.  **Documented Process:** Created this journal entry to document the meta-task and serve as a reference for understanding how the persona system operates.

**Technical Findings:**
- The `PersonaLoader` class correctly handles:
  - Jinja2 template inheritance (`{% extends "base/persona.md.j2" %}`)
  - Context variable injection (id, emoji, description, journal_entries, password, sprint_context_text)
  - Partial and block rendering (identity_branding, session_protocol, communication, etc.)
  - Journal collection (last 10 entries, with frontmatter stripping)
  - Sprint planning integration via `sprint_manager.get_sprint_context()`
- The base template follows the RGCCOV framework providing consistent structure across all personas
- Each persona's prompt is fully self-contained and provides all necessary context for autonomous operation

**Reflection:** This exercise validated that the persona prompt rendering system is robust and well-architected. The template inheritance model allows for:
- **Consistency:** All personas follow the same structural framework
- **Customization:** Each persona can override specific blocks for their unique role
- **Context Preservation:** Journal entries and sprint plans provide continuity across sessions
- **Autonomy:** Rendered prompts contain all necessary information for independent operation

The demonstration also confirms that even meta-tasks like "explain how personas work" can be executed by following a persona's workflow, making the system self-documenting.

**Next Steps:** 
- For future work, the persona rendering system could benefit from:
  - Documentation in `docs/` about the template architecture
  - Examples showing how to create new personas
  - Validation tests for template rendering
  - However, these are low-priority as the current system works well

This journal entry itself serves as documentation of the persona rendering process for future reference.
