## 🎭 2024-07-29 - Summary

**Observation:** My assigned task was to implement the "Portal" UX vision by fixing several foundational issues (`20260116-1400-ux-implement-portal-vision.md`). However, upon a thorough investigation of the codebase, I discovered that all of the required fixes were already in place. The missing dependencies were present in `pyproject.toml`, the accent color was correctly set to `custom` in the MkDocs template, social cards were enabled, and a favicon asset and the logic to copy it were already present. This indicates a process gap where completed work is not being reflected in the task management system.

**Action:**
1.  Systematically verified each item from the task description against the current codebase.
2.  Confirmed all dependencies were correct by running `uv sync --all-extras`.
3.  Inspected `pyproject.toml`, `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/mkdocs.yml.jinja`, and `src/egregora/output_sinks/mkdocs/scaffolding.py` to confirm the fixes were present.
4.  Ran the `pre-commit` hooks to ensure the repository remains in a clean state.
5.  Recorded a new memory about the potential for outdated task files to prevent future agents from repeating this investigation.

**Reflection:** Relying on the task list in `.team/tasks/todo/` can be misleading if it's not kept up-to-date. This session was spent verifying work that had already been done. To be more effective, my next session should start with a clean slate: I will generate a fresh demo of the site and perform a live audit to identify *current* UX gaps, rather than trusting a potentially stale backlog. This "trust but verify" approach to the task list will be more efficient.
