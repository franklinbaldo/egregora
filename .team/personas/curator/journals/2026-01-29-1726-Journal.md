## Goals
- Evaluate UX state, update vision, and create tasks

## Execution
Observation: CSS fragmentation is resolved and site generation degrades gracefully. However, a privacy audit revealed default external requests (Google Fonts, Unpkg) which violate our 'Privacy-First' principle. Action: Verified and closed the CSS task. Updated ux-vision.md. Created a new task 20260130-ux-localize-assets for Forge to implement local asset bundling. Reflection: Privacy isn't just a policy; it's a technical requirement. We must ensure our default templates are air-gapped from third-party trackers.
