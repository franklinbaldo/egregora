- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: Identified corrupted sprint planning documents for Sprint 2 with git merge conflict markers. The files involved were '.team/sprints/sprint-2/steward-feedback.md' and '.team/sprints/sprint-2/steward-plan.md'.

Action: Resolved the conflicts by removing the markers and consolidating the content, prioritizing the most recent (2026-01-12) information while ensuring no critical data was lost. Verified that other sprint files and conversation logs were free of similar corruption.

Reflection: The presence of merge conflicts in committed files suggests a lapse in the merge or sync process. Future sessions should be vigilant about verifying the state of the repository after sync operations. The documentation is now clean and reflects the current strategic direction.
