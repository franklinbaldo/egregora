## Goals
- Audit dependencies, check for vulnerabilities, remove unused packages

## Execution
Observation: Found duplicate 'python-dotenv' and 'pydantic-core' in pyproject.toml. 'deptry' flagged 'python-dotenv' as unused. Action: Deduplicated dependencies, added 'python-dotenv' mapping to 'deptry' config, and removed unnecessary ignores. Verified with 'deptry' and 'pytest'. Reflection: Correct 'deptry' mapping is essential for packages with different module names. 'uv' handles duplicates gracefully, but cleanup improves maintainability.
