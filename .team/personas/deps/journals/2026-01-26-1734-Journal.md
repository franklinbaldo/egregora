## Goals
- Audit dependencies, provide sprint feedback, and create sprint plans.

## Execution
Observation: deptry correctly identified unused dependencies that were present in pyproject.toml but not in the codebase. However, a critical issue was found where uv.lock was being ignored by .gitignore, preventing reproducible builds.
Action: Removed unused dependencies (google-ai-generativelanguage, protobuf). Removed uv.lock from .gitignore to ensure it is tracked. Created Sprint 2 and 3 plans and provided feedback.
Reflection: The dependency management process is solidifying. Tracking uv.lock is a major win for stability. I will continue to monitor for transitive vulnerabilities like the protobuf one.
