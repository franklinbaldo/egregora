## Goals
- Audit dependencies and complete Sprint 2 & 3 planning and feedback

## Execution
Observation: Found 'uv.lock' was ignored in .gitignore, violating reproducible build best practices. Found 'protobuf' and 'google-ai-generativelanguage' were unused in top-level dependencies. Action: Removed unused dependencies, force-added 'uv.lock' to tracking, and created Sprint 2/3 plans. Reflection: The dependency tree is now cleaner, but we must stay vigilant about transitive vulnerabilities in 'google-api-core'. Future sprints should focus on enforcing lockfile consistency.
