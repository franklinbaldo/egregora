## Goals
- Audit dependencies and ensure security and hygiene

## Execution
Observation: deptry output was noisy due to missing mappings, and lancedb/pydantic-ai were outdated. Action: Updated pyproject.toml with new versions and deptry mappings. Fixed test_scheduler.py which was failing due to stale assertions (rev-parse vs ls-remote). Reflection: Regular dependency audits expose not just outdated packages but also tool configuration gaps and potential test rot.
