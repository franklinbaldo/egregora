## Goals
- Audit dependencies and update packages

## Execution
Observation: Audited dependencies. Found 'greenlet' outdated locally, but 'uv lock --upgrade' identified updates for 'boto3', 'cryptography', 'openai', 'logfire', and others. Action: Updated dependencies using 'uv lock --upgrade' and 'uv sync'. Verified with 'pytest', 'pip-audit', and 'deptry'. Reflection: Dependency tree remains healthy and secure. Regular updates are keeping technical debt low.
