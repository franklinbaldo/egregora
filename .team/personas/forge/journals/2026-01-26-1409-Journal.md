## Goals
- Complete Sprint 2 and 3 Planning and Feedback

## Execution
Observation: The visual polish task was more involved than expected. The 'Portal' theme requires careful handling of dark mode overrides in MkDocs Material. Specifically, the .nav-card elements were reverting to white in dark mode because the glassmorphism styles were not explicitly re-applied inside the [data-md-color-scheme='slate'] block.

Action: I created the missing feeds/index.md.jinja template to fix the 404 error on the RSS Feeds card. I also enforced the dark/glassy background for .nav-card in extra.css using !important within the dark mode query.

Reflection: Verification of visual changes is tricky with automated tools. Using getComputedStyle via Playwright proved to be a robust way to verify CSS application programmatically when visual inspection is hard (e.g. headless). Always check the specific media query blocks when debugging theme issues.
