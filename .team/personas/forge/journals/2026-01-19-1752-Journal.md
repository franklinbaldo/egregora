## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution

**Observation:** The 'Portal Vision' task required fixing the generated site's branding (favicon, accent color) and fixing the developer experience (DX) of the  command.
I discovered that the templates  and  were *already* correctly implemented with the 'Portal' branding (, favicon present).
However, the  command was brittle: it would crash with a  (caused by ) if the AI generation failed, preventing the site scaffolding from being created or verified. This effectively blocked any frontend development or verification in environments without a perfect LLM setup.

**Action:**
1.  Modified  to allow  to propagate from  (similar to ) instead of forcing a .
2.  Updated  to catch  in the  command and fallback to scaffolding the site.
3.  Verified the fix by running  which triggered the fallback and successfully generated the site structure.
4.  Verified via a reproduction script that the generated  indeed contains  and the favicon is correctly copied to .
5.  Deleted an accidental  file that was introduced during setup.

**Reflection:**
The core issue was not the frontend templates themselves, but the fragility of the toolchain used to generate them. By making the  command robust to AI failures, I've improved the DX significantly, allowing frontend work to proceed even when backend services are flaky. Future work should continue to decouple the site structure generation from the content generation pipeline.
