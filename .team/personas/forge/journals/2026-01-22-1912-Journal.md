## Execution
## ⚒️ 2026-01-22 - Scoped Portal Theme Overrides

**Observation:**
The Portal theme (dark mode) was forcing all pages to have a maximum width of 100% via a global CSS override. This broke usability on standard documentation pages.

**Action:**
1. Modified `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/docs/stylesheets/extra.css`.
2. Changed the selector to `.md-main__inner:has(.homepage-hero)` to scope the override to the homepage.
3. Verified the fix using Playwright: Homepage remains 100% width, About page reverts to 1220px.

**Reflection:**
Using `:has()` allows clean scoping without template logic changes.
