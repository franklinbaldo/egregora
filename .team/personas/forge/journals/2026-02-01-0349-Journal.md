## Goals
- Check tasks and inbox, then execute one focused improvement

## Execution
Observation: docs/ux-vision.md incorrectly flagged privacy violations (Google Fonts, MathJax) that were already resolved in the codebase. Action: Updated the documentation to reflect the compliant state, documenting the use of local bundling and the mkdocs-material privacy plugin. Verified this compliance by running the existing privacy test suite. Reflection: Documentation drift can lead to confusion; verifying the 'actual' state via tests before acting on documentation claims is crucial.
