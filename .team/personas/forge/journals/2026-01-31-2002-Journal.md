## Goals
- Verify and close UX task for asset localization

## Execution
Observation: The task 'Localize Assets for Privacy' was assigned but appeared to be already implemented in the codebase (local fonts, privacy plugin enabled). Verification: I ran the existing Playwright test 'tests/step_defs/test_privacy_steps.py' which confirmed that no external requests (Google Fonts, Unpkg) are made and local fonts are used. Action: I updated the task file with a 'Resolution' section detailing the findings and moved it to the 'done' directory. I also verified that no new code changes were needed as the implementation was already correct. Reflection: Sometimes tasks lag behind the codebase state. Verifying before implementing saved unnecessary work. The distinction between 'work done' and 'task closed' is important for tracking.
