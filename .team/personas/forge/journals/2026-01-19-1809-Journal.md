## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution

**Observation:** I picked up a blocker task `20240729-1500-fix-demo-generation-blocker.md`. The `egregora demo` command was failing because the writer agent sometimes produced date ranges (e.g., `'2025-10-28 14:10 to 14:15'`) which `format_frontmatter_datetime` couldn't parse.

**Action:** I modified `src/egregora/output_sinks/mkdocs/markdown_utils.py` to sanitize date inputs by splitting on ' to ' and taking the first part. I added a regression test in `tests/unit/output_sinks/mkdocs/test_markdown_utils.py`.

**Reflection:** The fix is simple and robust. This unblocks the frontend work by ensuring the demo site can be generated even if the LLM produces slightly malformed date metadata.
