- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution

**Observation:** I identified that the 'Portal' theme had global CSS overrides that negatively affected standard content pages (like 'About'). I also saw that the navigation could be improved by grouping secondary items under 'Resources'.

**Action:**
1.  Refactored `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/overrides/main.html` to inject the homepage-specific CSS only when `page.is_homepage` is true.
2.  Removed the global overrides from `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/docs/stylesheets/extra.css`.
3.  Updated `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/mkdocs.yml.jinja` to nest 'Media' and 'About' under a 'Resources' tab.

**Reflection:** This pattern of using `main.html` overrides to conditionally inject CSS is much cleaner than relying on global styles or complex CSS selectors. It ensures the 'Portal' homepage remains immersive without breaking the readability of the rest of the site.
