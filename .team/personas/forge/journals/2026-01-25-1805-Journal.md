## Goals
- Check for tasks and implement assigned UX/UI improvements

## Execution
Observation: The default favicon was a placeholder raster image and social cards were not explicitly configured. Action: Created a custom SVG favicon (dark circle with cyan gradient) in src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/assets/images/ and updated mkdocs.yml.jinja to use it and explicitly enable social cards. Verified with Playwright. Reflection: Explicit configuration of cards: true ensures reliability. SVG favicons provide better scaling. Playwright verification of relative links requires regex matching as mkdocs serve resolves them to absolute URLs.
