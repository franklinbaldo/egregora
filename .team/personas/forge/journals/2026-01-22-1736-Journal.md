- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution

Observation: The 'egregora demo' command was failing abruptly with 'SystemExit(1)' when backend pipeline errors occurred (e.g., FileNotFoundError, API errors). This violated the 'Graceful Degradation' UX principle, as it prevented the site scaffolding from being created, blocking frontend development and verification.

Action:
1. Modified 'src/egregora/orchestration/pipelines/write.py' to add an 'exit_on_error' parameter to 'run_cli_flow'.
2. Updated 'run_cli_flow' to re-raise exceptions instead of calling 'SystemExit(1)' when 'exit_on_error' is False.
3. Updated 'src/egregora/cli/main.py' to call 'run_cli_flow' with 'exit_on_error=False' in the 'demo' command.
4. Broadened the exception handling in 'demo' command to catch all 'Exception' types and trigger the fallback scaffolding logic.

Reflection: This change ensures that the 'demo' command is resilient to backend failures. It decouples the site structure generation (scaffolding) from the content generation (LLM pipeline), allowing frontend work to proceed even if the AI pipeline is broken or misconfigured. This is a critical DX improvement. The 'write' command behavior remains unchanged (exits on error).
