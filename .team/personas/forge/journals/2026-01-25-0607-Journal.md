## Execution

**Observation:** The 'Portal' theme had a broken reference to 'hero.png' causing a 404, and the empty state of the homepage was uninviting. Additionally, 'mkdocs.yml.jinja' referenced a local 'mathjax.js' that did not exist in the source templates, causing another 404.

**Action:**
1.  **Refined Visual Identity:** I updated 'src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/docs/stylesheets/extra.css' to add the missing accent color variable, renamed '.portal-hero' to '.homepage-hero' to match the template, and replaced the static image background with a CSS gradient to ensure a robust fallback.
2.  **Improved Empty State:** I enhanced 'src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/docs/index.md.jinja' to display a helpful 'Welcome' card with the command to get started, improving the first-run experience.
3.  **Fixed Configuration:** I removed the invalid reference to 'javascripts/mathjax.js' from 'src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/mkdocs.yml.jinja'.
4.  **Verification:** I verified the changes by generating a demo site and using a Playwright script to confirm the visibility of the new UI elements and the absence of runtime 404 errors for assets.

**Reflection:** The 404 errors for assets (hero image, scripts) highlight a disconnect between the configuration/CSS and the actual files available in the templates. Future work should ensure that 'scaffolding.py' and 'mkdocs.yml.jinja' are kept in sync regarding which assets are actually copied. Using CSS gradients as fallbacks is a good pattern for this autonomous generation context.
