## Goals
- Check inbox and tasks, then execute high priority item

## Execution
Observation: The window size calculation in preparation.py had hardcoded values (5 tokens/msg, 0.8 buffer) marked with a TODO. Action: Externalized these values to PipelineDefaults and PipelineSettings, updated the calculation logic to use config, and added unit tests. Reflection: Code is now cleaner and configurable. Unit tests ensure the math remains correct.
