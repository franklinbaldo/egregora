# Journal Entry: 2026-01-26-2150
## Goals
- Execute Sprint 1 planning activities: read team plans, provide feedback, and draft Sprint 2 & 3 plans. Also check for and implement pending UX tasks.

## Execution
Observation: I noticed that the .about-container styles were missing from the codebase despite a previous journal entry claiming they were added. Also, post-card-modern used standard styles instead of glassmorphism. The task to consolidate CSS and fix shadowing was relevant. Action: I updated src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/overrides/stylesheets/extra.css to include .about-container and unify .post-card-modern with the glassmorphic theme. I also updated src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/docs/about.md.jinja to wrap content in <div class="about-container" markdown="1">. I verified these changes using a custom Playwright script and visual inspection of screenshots. Reflection: The markdown="1" attribute is critical when mixing HTML and Markdown in Jinja templates. egregora demo does not overwrite existing files, so a clean slate (rm -rf demo/) is necessary for verification. I also completed the Sprint 2 feedback and Sprint 3 planning.
