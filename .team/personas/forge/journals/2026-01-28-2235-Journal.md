## Goals
- Fix missing feeds page generation

## Execution
**Observation:** The RSS Feeds page was linked on the homepage but resulted in a 404 error because the template was not being scaffolded.

**Action:** I updated `src/egregora/output_sinks/mkdocs/scaffolding.py` to register the `docs/feeds/index.md.jinja` template. I verified the fix by regenerating the demo site and confirming the presence of the page with a Playwright script. I also verified the visual appearance of the glassmorphism cards.

**Reflection:** This was a straightforward configuration miss. It is important to ensure that all new templates are registered in the scaffolding logic.
