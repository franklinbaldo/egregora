## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: The 'Portal' theme had a performance bottleneck: it was using '@import' in 'extra.css' to load Google Fonts, which is render-blocking. It was also double-loading fonts (Roboto from default MkDocs config, plus custom fonts) and double-loading 'extra.css' due to a redundant '<link>' tag in 'main.html'.

Action:
1. Updated 'mkdocs.yml.jinja' to use 'Inter' as the text font (native loading) and move 'custom.js' to 'extra_javascript'.
2. Refactored 'main.html' to remove manual CSS/JS includes and add optimized '<link>' tags for the 'Outfit' font (headings).
3. Removed the '@import' from 'extra.css'.
4. Verified the fix with a Playwright script that confirmed no duplicate CSS and correct font loading.

Reflection: 'Performance is UX.' By optimizing how assets are loaded, we ensure the 'immersive' experience starts faster. Moving configuration to 'mkdocs.yml' also makes the system more maintainable and less prone to 'magic' includes in templates.
