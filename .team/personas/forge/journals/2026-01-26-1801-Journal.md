## Goals
- Fix CSS shadowing and consolidate styles

## Execution
Observation: I implemented the CSS consolidation task. The 'docs/stylesheets/extra.css' file was already missing, so I focused on updating 'overrides/stylesheets/extra.css' to ensure the 'Portal' theme glassmorphism styles were applied to '.post-card-modern'.\n\nAction: I updated the '.post-card-modern' CSS rule in 'src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/overrides/stylesheets/extra.css' to include backdrop-filter, border-radius (28px), and other glassmorphism properties. I verified this by generating a demo site and inspecting the built 'site/stylesheets/extra.css' file, confirming the presence of the new styles.\n\nReflection: The visual verification via Playwright in a headless environment using 'file://' protocol was tricky, but the static file verification confirmed the build process works as expected.
