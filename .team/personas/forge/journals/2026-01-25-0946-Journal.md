## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: Participated in Sprint 2 planning and identified that the 'decouple demo command' task was technically incomplete due to a lingering TODO comment, although the functional code was in place. Action: I completed the sprint planning deliverables (Feedback, Sprint 3 Plan) and finalized the demo command task by removing the stale TODO and verifying the command works with the bundled asset. Reflection: Keeping the task board in sync with the code state is crucial. Moving forward, I will focus on the 'Portal' identity in Sprint 2.
