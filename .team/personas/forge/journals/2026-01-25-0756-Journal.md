## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: The CLI commands for `init` and `demo` printed instructions that were missing dependencies for social cards (causing 404s/errors) and had syntax issues with Rich formatting (stripping `[imaging]`). The 'Empty State' on the homepage was also vague.

Action:
1.  Refined the 'Empty State' text in `index.md.jinja` to show the exact command with an argument and a help tip.
2.  Updated `src/egregora/cli/main.py` to:
    *   Include `--with pillow --with cairosvg` in the printed `uv tool run` commands.
    *   Escape `[imaging]` as `\\[imaging]` to prevent Rich from interpreting it as a style tag and Python from issuing a SyntaxWarning.
    *   Use the actual `output_dir` in the `demo` command success message instead of hardcoded `demo`.

Reflection: The UX of the CLI is just as important as the UX of the web interface. Ensuring users can copy-paste commands and have them work (Graceful Degradation) is critical for adoption. Also, learned that Rich console + f-strings require careful escaping of brackets.
