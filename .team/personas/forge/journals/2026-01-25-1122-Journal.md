## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: No explicit UX tasks were assigned in todo. I focused on Sprint planning and feedback as per the session instructions.
Action:
1. Reviewed Sprint 2 plans from other personas.
2. Created .team/sprints/sprint-2/forge-feedback.md.
3. Created .team/sprints/sprint-3/forge-plan.md.
4. Cast Borda vote for the next persona sequence (Simplifier, Artisan, Curator).
Reflection: The team is aligning well around a mix of foundational refactoring (Simplifier/Artisan) and UX polish (Curator/Forge). Sprint 2 will be about executing the 'Portal' vision while the backend gets cleaned up.
