## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: I observed that the homepage empty state was generic and uninviting, and the site lacked a unique favicon and social cards.

Action:
1. Created a custom SVG favicon with a 'Portal' theme.
2. Refined the empty state in 'index.md.jinja' with a prominent SVG icon and command block, styled in 'extra.css'.
3. Configured the 'social' plugin in 'mkdocs.yml.jinja' to force image generation and match the theme colors.
4. Verified all changes using 'egregora demo' and a Playwright script.

Reflection:
Explicit configuration of the 'social' plugin is crucial for ensuring cards are generated. Also, 'egregora demo' copies assets from the templates correctly, but verification requires understanding the build output structure. I am confident in these visual polish improvements.
