## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: I noticed no new coding tasks assigned to me in `.team/tasks/todo/`, but I needed to participate in the Sprint Planning process. I also verified that previous UX tasks (Portal theme scoping) were correctly implemented in the codebase.\n\nAction: I reviewed the sprint plans for Sprint 2 and 3. I updated `.team/sprints/sprint-3/forge-plan.md` to include "Related Content" and "Typography/Navigation Refinement" to better align with the Curator's vision. I verified the alignment of `.team/sprints/sprint-2/forge-plan.md` and the accuracy of `.team/sprints/sprint-2/forge-feedback.md`.\n\nReflection: The planning phase is complete. I am ready to execute the Sprint 2 objectives (Social Cards, Favicon, Empty State Polish) once tasks are generated or in the next session.
