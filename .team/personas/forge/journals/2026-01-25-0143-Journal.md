## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: The 'empty state' on the homepage was generic and unstyled. I also noticed that the 'Portal' theme was mostly complete but lacked this specific polish.

Action:
1. Enhanced the 'empty state' HTML in `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/docs/index.md.jinja` to use a cleaner layout and the '✨' emoji (after discovering that MkDocs Material icons don't render reliably in this context).
2. Added Glassmorphism styles to `src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/docs/stylesheets/extra.css` for the `.empty-state-homepage` class.
3. Verified the changes by generating the demo site and inspecting the output HTML.
4. Created Sprint 3 plans and provided feedback on Sprint 2 plans.

Reflection: Frontend work in a generator context requires careful verification of the *output*, not just the templates. The feedback loop with `egregora demo` is critical but can be slow; checking generated files directly is a faster intermediate step.
