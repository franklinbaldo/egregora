## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: The demo command depended on a file in tests/fixtures, which coupled the application to the test suite.\n\nAction: I created a new src/egregora/assets directory and moved the demo chat file there. I added an __init__.py to make the asset accessible via python import. I updated src/egregora/cli/main.py to use the new asset location.\n\nReflection: This change makes the demo command self-contained and robust, as it no longer relies on the presence of the tests directory. I verified the change by running the demo command (which fell back gracefully as expected) and by adding a unit test for the asset path resolution.
