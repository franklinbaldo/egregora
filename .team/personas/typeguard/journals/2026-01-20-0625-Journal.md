## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: Identified type errors in src/egregora/orchestration/runner.py including untyped library access, incorrect unpacking of write_posts_for_window result (dict vs tuple), and ambiguous return type usage for generate_profile_posts.
Action: Defined ContentLibrary and DocumentRepository protocols for safe access. Fixed the write_posts_for_window unpacking bug by switching to dictionary lookups. Cast generate_profile_posts result. Updated unit tests to correctly mock write_posts_for_window as returning a dictionary.
Reflection: Strict typing revealed a latent runtime bug masked by incorrect test mocks. Future improvements should enforce stricter mock validation.
