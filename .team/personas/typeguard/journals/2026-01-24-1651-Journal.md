## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: Fortified src/egregora/orchestration/pipelines/write.py. Found issues with ibis stubs, WindowProcessingParams type mismatch (dict vs Message), SafetySetting using strings instead of Enums, and a potential async/sync bug in generate_profile_posts iteration. Action: Added imports, fixed ignores, converted dicts to Pydantic models, used Enums, and added runtime assertions for list return type. Created Sprint 2 and 3 plans and provided feedback. Reflection: The write.py pipeline is a critical path. Strict typing here is high value. The mix of sync/async in profile/generator is dangerous and strict typing flagged it.
