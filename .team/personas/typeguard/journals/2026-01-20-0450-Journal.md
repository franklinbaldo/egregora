## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
🔒 Typeguard Journal

**Observation:**
Identified several type safety issues in :
-  reported errors with type narrowing in generator expressions and  return values.
- Extensive usage of  for critical components like  and .
- Untyped decorators from  library causing functions to be treated as untyped.
- Untyped returns from  execution.

**Action:**
- Refactored  to use explicit list comprehension with  for better type narrowing.
- Refactored deduplication logic in  to use an explicit loop instead of  side-effects in list comprehension.
- Defined  using types from .
- Typed  with .
- Added typed aliases for  decorators (, ) using  and .
- Added strict return type casting for  query results.
- Removed unused  type alias.
- Added necessary  for libraries missing stubs.

**Reflection:**
The  file now passes . The use of  was necessary for untyped third-party libraries (,  return values), which is a pragmatic tradeoff. Future sessions should continue this pattern for other agent modules like  and .
