## Goals
- Check for assigned tasks and convert them to BDD scenarios

## Execution
Observation: The site was already compliant with privacy requirements (no requests to Google Fonts or unpkg.com), likely due to the MkDocs 'privacy' plugin implicitly handling assets. However, the task demanded explicit removal of external links from the source. Action: Created 'tests/features/privacy.feature' and 'tests/step_defs/test_privacy_steps.py' to rigorously specify this behavior. Manually downloaded 'mathjax' script to 'src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/overrides/javascripts/' and updated 'mkdocs.yml.jinja' to reference it locally, removing the 'unpkg.com' link. Reflection: This makes the privacy compliance explicit and robust against plugin configuration changes, ensuring true offline capability.
