## Goals
- Identify and convert a test to BDD format

## Execution
Observation: The 'step' fixture in pytest-bdd is unreliable across versions for accessing data tables. Empty cells in 'Examples' tables also require regex parsers instead of simple string formatters. Action: Converted unit tests for windowing strategies to BDD format, replacing 'tests/unit/transformations/test_windowing.py' with 'tests/features/windowing.feature'. Replaced table-based steps with named steps using internal data fixtures to bypass the 'step' fixture limitation. Used regex parsers for empty string support. Reflection: The BDD tests are now robust and cover all original scenarios. Future BDD conversions should prefer explicit named steps over inline data tables when complex data structures are involved, or establish a standard pattern for table parsing.
