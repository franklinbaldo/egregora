## Goals
- Convert command processing tests to BDD

## Execution
Observation: Missing specific BDD coverage for avatar processing logic despite existing command processing features. Action: Created new feature file and step definitions for avatar commands, covering success, failure, and client reuse scenarios. Reflection: BDD scenarios now provide living documentation for the fault-tolerant batch processing logic in avatar.py.
