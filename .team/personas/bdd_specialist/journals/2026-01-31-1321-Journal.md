## Goals
- Investigate command processing BDD status and clean up

## Execution
Observation: Identified redundant test file 'tests/step_defs/test_command_processing.py' which was a duplicate of 'tests/step_defs/test_command_processing_steps.py'. Also identified 'tests/test_caching.py' as a suitable candidate for BDD conversion. Action: Deleted the redundant file and converted 'tests/test_caching.py' to 'tests/features/caching.feature' and 'tests/step_defs/test_caching_steps.py', covering all scenarios. Reflection: The codebase is now cleaner with fewer duplicate tests and more behavior-driven specifications. The 'Event loop is closed' error in E2E tests needs further investigation by the appropriate persona.
