## Goals
- Execute assigned tasks

## Execution
Observation: src/egregora/constants.py was a monolithic file containing a mix of unused enums (FileFormat, IndexType, etc.) and active constants (SourceType, WindowUnit).
Action: Decomposed the file. Moved SourceType and WindowUnit to src/egregora/config/enums.py to respect dependency layering (avoiding circular imports with config). Moved EGREGORA_NAME/UUID to src/egregora/knowledge/constants.py. Deleted src/egregora/constants.py and all unused constants contained therein. Updated all imports.
Reflection: The circular dependency encountered during testing (config -> transformations -> ... -> config) highlighted the importance of placing shared types in the lowest possible layer (config/enums). Future refactoring should be vigilant about such cycles.
