**Persona:** Visionary 🔭
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-26
>>>>>>> origin/pr/2835
**Priority:** High

## Objectives

<<<<<<< HEAD
Describe the main objectives for this sprint:

- [ ] Finalize integration of `CodeReferenceDetector` into the main pipeline (Enricher Agent) (RFC 027).
- [ ] Start API design for Universal Context Layer (RFC 026).
- [ ] Create "Hello World" VS Code Plugin that queries the local API.

## Dependencies

List dependencies from other personas:

- **Architect:** Review of Context Layer API design (REST vs MCP).
- **Sheriff:** Setup of integration tests for the VS Code plugin.

## Context

Explain the context and reasoning behind this plan:

With the historical database (RFC 027) working, we can start exposing this data to external tools (RFC 026). The VS Code plugin will serve as a proof of concept for the "Ubiquitous Memory" vision.

## Expected Deliverables

1. Feature RFC 027 complete and merged (Historical links on blog).
2. OpenAPI Spec for Context Layer API.
3. `egregora-vscode` repository with basic plugin.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| API Complexity | Medium | High | Adopt MCP (Model Context Protocol) standard to simplify |
| Plugin Overhead | Low | Low | Keep plugin "dumb", logic on Egregora server |

## Proposed Collaborations

- **With Architect:** Definition of API endpoints.
- **With Forge:** Help with TypeScript for the VS Code plugin.

## Additional Notes

Critical sprint for transition from "Generator" to "Platform".
=======
**Persona:** Visionary 🔭
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** High

## Objectives
My mission is to implement the "Reflective Prompt Optimization" loop (RFC 029), turning the design from Sprint 2 into working code.

- [ ] **Implement `ReflectivePromptOptimizer`:** Build the logic to parse journals and generate updated Pydantic settings / Jinja templates.
- [ ] **Build `egregora optimize-prompts`:** Implement the CLI command.
- [ ] **End-to-End Test:** specific test case where a "mock journal" triggers a real configuration update PR.
- [ ] **Draft RFC 030 (Topology Mutation):** Explore how the system could spawn *new* agents, not just tune existing ones.

## Dependencies
- **Visionary (Sprint 2):** The Schema and Design must be complete.
- **Simplifier (Sprint 2):** The `write.py` refactor must be stable.

## Context
Sprint 3 is the "Symbiote Shift". We are enabling the system to act on its own insights. This is the first time Egregora will modify itself.

## Expected Deliverables
1.  **Code:** `src/egregora/reflection/optimizer.py`.
2.  **CLI:** `egregora optimize-prompts` command.
3.  **RFC 030:** "Topology Mutation" (Draft).

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| LLM Hallucinations in Config | High | High | The CLI will *always* require human confirmation (or a PR review) before applying changes. |
| "Feedback Loop" instability | Low | Medium | We will implement versioning for prompts so we can rollback easily. |

## Proposed Collaborations
- **With Forge:** To visualize the "Optimization Diff" in the CLI or a web UI.
- **With Sapper:** To ensure invalid mutations are caught gracefully.

=======
My mission for this sprint is to prototype the "Active Maintainer" (Moonshot) by building the first "Janitor Agent".

- [ ] **Janitor Agent Prototype:** Create `JanitorAgent` using `pydantic-ai` capable of basic AST analysis (RFC 028).
- [ ] **Refactoring Skill:** Implement a specific skill: "Add Missing Docstrings".
- [ ] **Sandboxing:** Implement a `GitSandbox` that allows the agent to modify code in a temporary branch without pushing.
- [ ] **Integration Test:** Run the Janitor against the `egregora` codebase itself (dogfooding) in "Dry Run" mode.

## Dependencies

- **Sentinel:** Review the sandboxing approach to ensure the agent cannot leak secrets or destroy data.
- **Sheriff:** Ensure the generated PRs pass CI checks.

## Context

With "Dry Run Mode" (Sprint 2) in place, we can safely let an AI agent propose code changes. This sprint moves from "Simulation" to "Action", but restricts the action to a safe, verifiable task (adding docstrings).

## Expected Deliverables

1.  `src/egregora/agents/janitor.py` (Prototype).
2.  `src/egregora/ops/sandbox.py` (Safe execution environment).
3.  Proof-of-Concept PR generated by the agent adding docstrings to `write.py`.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| AI breaks code | High | High | Agent runs in `dry_run` mode by default; PRs require human review. |
| Hallucinations | Medium | Medium | Restrict the prompt to *only* add docstrings, forbid changing logic. |

## Proposed Collaborations

- **With Sentinel:** Security review of the `GitSandbox`.
- **With Refactor:** Define the "Code Quality Standards" the agent should enforce.
