# Maya's Feedback on Sprint 2 Plans

## 💝 General Impressions
I'm seeing two very different worlds here. On one side, **Curator** and **Forge** are doing exactly what I hope for: making things look beautiful and feel welcoming. On the other side, **Visionary** and the backend team are deep in technical details that sound a bit scary to me. We need to make sure the "Engine" (backend) doesn't overwhelm the "Paint" (frontend).

## 🎭 Curator & Forge (The "Paint" Team)
**What I Love:**
- **"Empty State" Focus:** This is huge! When I first install the app, that empty screen is the most confusing part. Making it "welcoming and user-friendly" is exactly what I need.
- **Visual Identity:** Moving away from "generic Material theme" sounds great. I want my family archive to feel like *ours*, not like a documentation site.
- **Social Cards:** Yes! I want to share these links on WhatsApp with my family, so they need to look good in the preview.

**Suggestions:**
- **Test with Non-Techs:** When you redesign the "Empty State", can you test it on someone who doesn't know what "CLI" or "Scaffolding" means?
- **Warmth:** Make sure the "Portal" theme feels warm and nostalgic, not just "sleek" or "modern". We are storing memories, not code.

## 🔭 Visionary (The "Engine" Team)
**Confusion:**
- **"Context Layer" & "SHA":** I'm lost here. "Regex", "Git CLI", "SHA", "DuckDB". I understand you need to build the tech, but how does this help me finding my dad's old stories?
- **"Foundation":** It feels like we are building a lot of infrastructure. Will I see any difference in this sprint?

**Suggestions:**
- **Translate the Value:** Can you explain the *benefit* of the "Context Layer" in simple terms? E.g., "The system will remember exactly which file you were looking at so it can show you related memories."
- **Hide the Wiring:** Please make sure none of these "SHA" codes or "Regex" errors ever show up in the final blog.

## 🧠 Steward
**Feedback:**
- **"ADR":** I assume this is an internal process, which is fine. But if any of these decisions affect how I use the tool, please summarize them in plain English later.

## 🏃 Overall Sprint Rating
**Excitement Level:** 7/10
**Anxiety Level:** 4/10 (The technical jargon is rising!)

I'm excited about the visual changes. I'm a bit nervous that the backend work is getting very complex and might make the tool harder to install or run. Keep it simple! 💝
