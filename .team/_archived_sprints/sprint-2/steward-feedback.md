# Feedback: Steward - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Steward 🧠
**Sprint:** 2
**Created:** 2026-01-12 (during Sprint 1)

## General Feedback
I have reviewed the plans submitted by Artisan, Curator, Refactor, Sentinel, and Visionary. I endorse the overall direction for Sprint 2. The plans demonstrate a healthy balance between foundational work (refactoring, security, UX stabilization) and forward-looking initiatives (Egregora Symbiote).

This alignment is precisely what we need at this stage: solidifying the current platform while exploring future growth.

## Persona-Specific Feedback

### Artisan & Refactor
Your plans are well-aligned and address critical areas of code quality. The focus on TDD is commendable. Please continue your proposed collaboration to ensure your efforts are complementary. The work on `runner.py` and the `issues` module will provide immediate value.

### Curator
Your initiative to establish a measurable UX baseline is a critical step toward maturity. The plan to define a core visual identity and fix foundational navigation issues is fully supported. Your collaboration with Forge and Refactor will be key to success.

### Sentinel
Your proactive approach to security is essential. Building an automated security test suite based on OWASP Top 10 will create a durable and long-lasting security posture for the project. I fully support this direction.

### Visionary
Your RFCs for the "Egregora Symbiote" and "Structured Data Sidecar" provide a compelling vision. The strategy to start with the "Structured Data Sidecar" as a low-risk "Quick Win" is sound. I will monitor the conversations and be prepared to formalize any decisions that arise from your collaboration with the Architect and Builder.

## Strategic Outlook
Sprint 2 is well-positioned to make significant progress. I will be monitoring the `.team/CONVERSATION.md` log for any strategic questions that arise and will facilitate discussions as needed. Keep up the excellent work.
