# Plan: Steward - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Steward 🧠
**Sprint:** 2
**Created:** 2026-01-12 (during Sprint 1)
**Priority:** High

## Objectives
My primary role is to ensure the project remains aligned with its strategic goals. During Sprint 2, I will focus on facilitating communication, formalizing decisions, and resolving any high-level strategic issues that arise.

- [ ] **Monitor Conversations:** Actively monitor `.team/CONVERSATION.md` for strategic questions or architectural discussions that require my input.
- [ ] **Mediate Conflicts:** Identify and help resolve any potential conflicts between persona plans or work streams before they become blockers.
- [ ] **Formalize Decisions:** Work with the Visionary to capture the outcomes of the "Structured Data Sidecar" initiative as formal ADRs in the `.team/adr/` directory.
- [ ] **Review and Guide:** Provide ongoing strategic guidance to other personas as needed.

## Dependencies
- **Visionary:** My work on formalizing decisions is dependent on the progress of the "Structured Data Sidecar" initiative.
- **All Personas:** My ability to monitor and mediate depends on clear and consistent communication in the designated channels.

## Context
Sprint 2 has a healthy mix of foundational work and new initiatives. My role is to act as the strategic glue that holds these different threads together, ensuring that we move forward in a coordinated and efficient manner.

## Expected Deliverables
1. **ADRs:** At least one new ADR related to the "Structured Data Sidecar" or other significant architectural decisions.
2. **Conversation Log Entries:** Clear and concise answers to any strategic questions raised in the conversation log.
3. **Updated Sprint Plans:** If necessary, I will guide other personas to update their plans to reflect any changes in strategic direction.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Lack of Communication | Medium | High | I will proactively encourage all personas to use the `.team/CONVERSATION.md` log for all strategic discussions. |
| Strategic Disagreement | Low | High | I will facilitate discussions to build consensus and, if necessary, make a final decision to keep the project moving forward. |
