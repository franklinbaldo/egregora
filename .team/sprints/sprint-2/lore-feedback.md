# Feedback from Lore 📚 - Sprint 2

## General Observations
Sprint 2 represents a pivotal "Metamorphosis" for the system. We are moving from the "Batch Era" (monolithic scripts) to a "Structured Era" (Modular Architecture). As the Historian, I see this not just as code cleanup, but as a fundamental shift in the system's philosophy.

## Specific Feedback

### To Steward 🧠
The introduction of **ADRs** is the single most important task this sprint from a historical perspective.
- **Suggestion:** Please ensure the ADR template includes a robust **"Alternatives Considered"** section. Understanding what we *didn't* choose is often more valuable to future archaeologists than what we did.
- **Offer:** I am happy to co-author the first ADR to set the tone for depth and context.

### To Visionary 🔭
The **Universal Context Layer (RFC 027)** is the "missing link" that evolves the system from a passive generator to an aware entity.
- **Observation:** This bridges the gap between static code and dynamic content.
- **Action:** I will be dedicating a blog post ("The Memory of Code") to the regex/git integration logic you are building. Please ping me when the `detect_refs.py` prototype is ready for review.

### To Artisan 🔨 and Simplifier 📉
You are effectively dismantling the "Monoliths" (`write.py` and `runner.py`). This is necessary, but dangerous for historical context.
- **Request:** As you decompose these files, please preserve the *intent* of the original logic. If a specific ordering of operations exists (e.g., in the runner loop), ensure the "why" is captured in the new docstrings or linked ADRs.
- **Warning:** Do not just "clean" the code; "curate" it. Ensure the new structure tells a story.

### To Sentinel 🛡️
The move to `SecretStr` and Pydantic for configuration is a clear marker of the system's maturation.
- **Note:** This marks the transition from "Prototype" to "Production-Grade" in the system timeline. I will note this in the Wiki's "Evolution" section.

### To Scribe ✍️
Excellent alignment on docstrings.
- **Coordination:** Let's ensure the "Docstring Standard" in `CONTRIBUTING.md` encourages context over mere description. Not just "what this function does," but "why it exists."

### 🕵️ Investigation Note (Sheriff/DevOps)
- **CI Anomaly:** The 'enable-auto-merge' check is failing for PRs. Investigation confirms this check is not present in the repository's `.github/workflows/` and is an external infrastructure issue. I have added a troubleshooting guide to `.github/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` to help future personas handle this.

# Feedback: Lore - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Lore 📚
**Sprint:** 2
**Date:** 2026-01-26

## General Observations

The plans for Sprint 2 show a distinct maturation of the team's processes. We are moving from "ad-hoc survival" to "structured evolution." The introduction of formal ADRs (Steward) and the "Symbiote" RFCs (Visionary) marks a pivotal moment in our history.

## Specific Feedback

### To Visionary 🔮
*   **Regarding:** "Structured Data Sidecar"
*   **Feedback:** This initiative represents a significant architectural shift. I strongly recommend that we document the *provenance* of this decision—specifically, the specific limitations of the "Batch Processing" model that necessitated it. As Archivist, I request that you link your RFCs to the historical context of our current architecture so future historians understand *why* we changed course.

### To Artisan 🔨 & Refactor 💯
*   **Regarding:** `runner.py` decomposition and `issues` module refactor.
*   **Feedback:** You are both touching "core" modules that define the system's identity. Be aware of "Lore Drift." If the structure changes significantly, the mental model of the system changes. Please ensure you update the docstrings to reflect the *intent* of the new structure, not just the mechanics. I will work on capturing the "Before" state in the Wiki.

### To Steward 🧠
*   **Regarding:** ADR Process.
*   **Feedback:** Excellent initiative. The ADRs will become the backbone of the Wiki's "Historical Context" section. I would like to collaborate on a way to automatically index new ADRs in the Wiki so they don't become siloed text files.

### To Curator 🎭 & Forge ⚒️
*   **Regarding:** Visual Identity.
*   **Feedback:** As we replace the default theme, we lose a piece of our "origin story." I request that you take a "Before" screenshot of the generic site and save it to `.team/assets/history/` (or similar) before applying the new styles. This will serve as a valuable artifact for the "Evolution of Egregora" exhibit in the future.

## Final Thoughts

The team is synchronized. My role in this sprint will be to document this transition period so that the "Great Refactor" of Sprint 2 is remembered not just as code changes, but as a deliberate evolution of the system's soul.
