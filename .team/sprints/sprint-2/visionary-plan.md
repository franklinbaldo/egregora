# Plan: Visionary - Sprint 2
**Persona:** Visionary 🔮
**Sprint:** 2
**Created:** 2024-07-26 (during Sprint 1)
**Priority:** High

## Goals
The primary goal for Sprint 2 is to move the "Egregora Symbiote" vision from concept to a tangible, project-wide initiative. This involves socializing the RFCs and laying the practical groundwork for the "Structured Data Sidecar."

- [ ] Socialize the Moonshot & Quick Win RFCs with all personas.
- [ ] Collaborate with the Architect and Builder to spec out the technical implementation of the "Structured Data Sidecar."
- [ ] Identify and analyze 2-3 new, emerging AI research papers that could accelerate the Symbiote's development.
- [ ] Draft a "v0.1" of a real-time adapter framework RFC.

## Dependencies
- **Architect:** Input on the technical feasibility and architectural impact of the "Structured Data Sidecar."
- **Builder:** Collaboration on a proof-of-concept for modifying the Writer agent's prompt and parsing its output.

## Context
In Sprint 1, I identified the "Reactive, Batch-Processing" assumption as the key limiter of Egregora's potential. I drafted two RFCs to challenge this: the "Egregora Symbiote" (Moonshot) and the "Structured Data Sidecar" (Quick Win). Sprint 2 is about building consensus and starting the initial, low-risk implementation work. The goal is to end the sprint with a project-wide agreement on the vision and a clear, buildable plan for the Quick Win.

## Expected Deliverables
1. **RFC Consensus:** Documented feedback and buy-in from other key personas on both RFCs.
2. **Technical Spec:** A collaborative document outlining the implementation plan for the "Structured Data Sidecar."
3. **Research Brief:** A short document summarizing the findings from the AI research papers and their potential application to Egregora.
4. **Draft RFC:** A new RFC file for the "Real-Time Adapter Framework."

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resistance to Paradigm Shift | Medium | High | Frame the vision through the low-risk, high-value "Structured Data Sidecar" Quick Win. Focus on the immediate, tangible benefits. |
| Technical Complexity | Low | Medium | The "Structured Data Sidecar" is designed to be a low-complexity probe. Work closely with the Architect to validate this assumption early. |
| Distraction from Current Priorities | Medium | Medium | Clearly articulate how this vision supports and enhances the existing roadmap, rather than replacing it. |

## Proposed Collaborations
- **With Architect & Builder:** A dedicated workshop session to break down the "Structured Data Sidecar" into buildable tasks.
- **With Curator:** Discuss how the structured data from conversations can be combined with the structured metadata from issues to create a richer knowledge graph.
