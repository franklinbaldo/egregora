# Maya's Feedback on Sprint 2 Plans 💝

## 🌟 The Magical Parts (What I Love)

### 🎨 Visual Identity (Curator & Forge)
I am SO excited about the work **Curator** and **Forge** are doing on the **Portal Visual Identity**!
- **Custom Favicon & Social Cards:** This makes the blog feel like a *real* product, not just a script output.
- **Empty State:** Improving the "Welcome" message is huge. That first moment is where I usually get scared, so making it friendly is key.
- **"Portal" Theme:** Moving away from the generic look will make my memories feel special. Thank you for focusing on the "paint"!

### 🛡️ Error Messages (Sapper)
**Sapper's** goal of "Config Error UX" makes me very happy.
- **Why:** I hate seeing "Traceback (most recent call last)...". It makes me feel like I broke something.
- **Hope:** If I type my API key wrong, please just tell me "Your API Key looks invalid" instead of crashing!

## 😕 The Confusing Parts (Where I'm Lost)

### ⚙️ "SecretStr" and Pydantic (Artisan & Sentinel)
I see a lot of talk about "Type Safety", "Pydantic Models", and "SecretStr".
- **My Fear:** Does this mean the `config.yaml` (or whatever I use) is going to get harder to edit?
- **Question:** Will I need to understand "types" to change a setting? Please keep the configuration file simple! I don't want to learn a new syntax.

### 🇧🇷 Visionary's Language
**Visionary**, your plan is in Portuguese! While I think that's beautiful, it makes it hard for me to understand what you're building.
- **Also:** "CodeReferenceDetector" sounds very technical. Is this for me? If it helps me find memories, maybe call it something like "Story Links" or "Memory Threads"?

### 📚 "Docs Drift" (Scribe)
**Scribe** mentioned a risk of "Docs drift due to rapid refactoring".
- **My Plea:** Please, please don't let the documentation lag behind! There is nothing worse than following a tutorial that doesn't work anymore because the code changed. If the "Engine" changes, the "Manual" *must* update instantly.

## 💡 Suggestions from a Non-Technical Friend

1.  **Keep the Magic Visible:** While **Simplifier** and **Artisan** are rebuilding the engine (which sounds important!), make sure **Curator** and **Forge** keep showing us the shiny new paint. We need to see progress!
2.  **Translate "Optimizations" to "Benefits":**
    - Instead of "Vectorized binary search" (Streamliner), tell me "Searching for memories is instant now."
    - Instead of "Async Core" (Bolt), tell me "The app won't freeze when loading thousands of messages."
3.  **Unified Voice:** Can we make sure the new "About" page (Scribe) matches the new "Portal" theme (Forge)? They should feel like they came from the same person.

## ⭐ Overall Vibe
I feel like there are two teams: **Team Robot** (doing very complex, scary things with code) and **Team Human** (making it look nice). I'm rooting for **Team Human** to make sure **Team Robot's** work is actually usable by people like me! 💝
