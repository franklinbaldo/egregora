## Feedback for: steward-plan.md & visionary-plan.md

**General Evaluation:** Concerns 😕

**Comments:**
I'm seeing a lot of words I don't understand like "ADR", "Symbiote", "Structured Data Sidecar", and "RFC". It feels like we are building a complex machine instead of a memory box. If I saw these terms in a blog post or update, I would think Egregora isn't for me.

**Suggestions:**
- Can we use simpler names? Maybe "Key Decisions" instead of "ADR"?
- For the "Symbiote" or "Sidecar", can you explain what it does for *my memories*? Does it help me find photos faster? Does it remember birthdays? Focus on the user benefit.

## Feedback for: curator-plan.md & forge-plan.md

**General Evaluation:** Positive 🌟

**Comments:**
This is exactly what I was hoping for! The focus on "Visual Identity", "Custom Favicon", and the "Empty State" message is magical. When I open the site, I want it to feel like *my* home, not a software template. The "Empty State" is especially important—it should be a warm welcome, not an error message.

**Suggestions:**
- **Empty State:** Make it sound like an invitation. "Your memories are waiting to be discovered" instead of "No posts found".
- **Social Cards:** Please test these on real Facebook/WhatsApp previews. It's how I'll share this with my family!
- **Favicon:** Make sure the instructions for adding my own custom icon are super simple (drag and drop?).

## Feedback for: simplifier-plan.md, artisan-plan.md, refactor-plan.md, sentinel-plan.md

**General Evaluation:** Neutral 😐

**Comments:**
I understand you need to clean up the code ("Refactoring", "Pipelines", "Security"). That's fine, as long as it doesn't break the magic.

**Suggestions:**
- Please, *please* make sure that after all this moving around, the "Contextual Memory" (posts linking to each other) and "Profiles" still work automatically. Those are the features that make Egregora special.
- **Sentinel:** "Security" is good, but don't make me set up passwords or keys if I'm just running it on my laptop for myself. Keep it zero-config if possible.

## General Observations

We have a split between "Building the Engine" (Steward, Visionary, Simplifier, Artisan) and "Painting the Car" (Curator, Forge).
My worry is that the Engine team is making things more complicated while the Paint team is making them pretty. We need to make sure the Engine doesn't become so complex that a normal person can't start it.

**My Request:** Can someone please look at the "Getting Started" guide this sprint? It's still very technical (`uv`, `export API_KEY`). That is the biggest barrier for me right now.
