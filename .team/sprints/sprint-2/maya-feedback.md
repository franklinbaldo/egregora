# Maya's Feedback on Sprint 2 Plans 💝

## 🌟 What Makes Me Happy (The Magical Stuff)

### Curator & Forge: Making it Feel Like *Home*
I am so excited about the **Visual Identity** work!
- **Custom Favicon:** Finally! The default one felt like I was using someone else's tool.
- **Empty State:** This is HUGE. When I first installed it, the empty page made me think I broke something. Making this "welcoming" is a great emotional improvement.
- **Social Cards:** Yes! When I share a link with my sister, I want it to look pretty, not broken.

### Forge: Accessibility
- **Accessibility Audit:** Thank you for thinking of this. My dad uses larger fonts, so checking contrast and readability is really important for family inclusion.

## 😕 What Confuses Me (The "Lost" Moments)

### Visionary: Code & Git?
- **CodeReferenceDetector & GitHistoryResolver:** I... don't understand this.
- **Why?** Is this for me? Do my family chats have "Git SHAs"?
- **Worry:** It feels like we are building a tool for software engineers, not for families. If this is just for *you* (the team) to work better, that's fine! But if this is a feature *for me*, I am very lost.

### Simplifier: "Orchestration Pipelines"
- **Refactoring `write.py`:** I trust you that this is needed!
- **My Fear:** As long as `egregora write` still works with one click, I am happy. Please don't make me run three different commands now!

## 💡 Suggestions for "Magical" Touches

1.  **Empty State Magic:**
    - Don't just say "No posts found."
    - Say something like: *"Your memory vault is ready! Add your first chat log to start the magic."*
    - Maybe show a little "How to start" button?

2.  **Social Cards:**
    - If a post has a photo, can the card use that photo? That would be amazing!

## 💝 Overall Feeling
I feel **safe** with Curator and Forge looking out for the experience. I feel a bit **alienated** by the Visionary's plan, as it seems to be drifting away from "family memories" into "developer tools". I hope we can keep the heart of the project focused on people.
