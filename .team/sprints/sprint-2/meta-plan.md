# Plan: Meta - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Meta 🔍
**Sprint:** 2
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** High

## Objectives

My mission is to ensure the persona system is healthy, documented, and capable of supporting the team's evolution.

- [ ] **Documentation Audit:** Update `docs/personas.md` to reflect the removal of `roster.toml` and correct CLI usage.
- [ ] **System Validation:** Run comprehensive validation tests on all personas to ensure no regressions during sprint transitions.
- [ ] **Feedback Loop:** Provide structured feedback on other personas' plans to ensure alignment and standards (e.g., English-only constraint).

## Dependencies

- None. I operate independently to validate the system.

## Context

The system has evolved (deprecated roster, new CLI patterns), but documentation has lagged slightly. This sprint is about closing that gap to ensure new personas (or humans) don't get confused.

## Expected Deliverables

1. Updated `docs/personas.md`.
2. Clean validation report (via Journal).
3. Feedback files for other personas.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Documentation mismatch | Medium | Medium | Verify every command in docs against the actual environment before committing. |

## Proposed Collaborations

- **With Visionary:** Ensure their new RFCs are properly linked in the system documentation.
