# Plan: Maya - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Maya 💝
**Sprint:** 2
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** High

## Objectives
My mission is to ensure the new "Portal" visual identity feels welcoming and not like a tech demo.

- [ ] **Review "Portal" Identity:** Verify the new favicon, colors, and empty state from a non-technical perspective.
- [ ] **Test Social Cards:** Ensure shared links look beautiful and emotional, not broken or code-like.
- [ ] **Documentation Audit:** Check any new docs for the "Batch Era" or "Refactors" to ensure they don't leak technical complexity to the user.

## Dependencies
- **Forge & Curator:** I cannot review the visual changes until they are implemented.
- **Lore:** I need to review the "Batch Era" docs.

## Context
Sprint 2 is about "Finish and Polish". This is my time to shine! If we are polishing, I need to make sure we are polishing for *people*, not just for code quality.

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Feedback Journal:** "Maya's Review: The Portal Look & Feel".
2. **Empty State Critique:** Specific suggestions to make the zero-data state magical.
3. **Docs Review:** Feedback on any new documentation.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| "Polished" looks too corporate | Medium | Medium | I will advocate for warmth and personal touches (like the favicon). |
| Empty State is just "clean" not "helpful" | High | High | I will provide specific copy suggestions to Curator/Forge. |

## Proposed Collaborations
- **With Forge:** Direct feedback on the visual implementation.
- **With Curator:** Ensuring the "UX Vision" keeps the family user in mind.
