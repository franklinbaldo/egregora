# Plan: Maya 💝 - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Maya 💝
**Sprint:** 2
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** High

## Objectives

My mission is to ensure the "polish" phase results in a truly welcoming experience for non-technical users.

- [ ] **Review "Empty State" Experience:** I will test the new "Empty State" implemented by Curator and Forge. It needs to be warm, inviting, and clearly explain what to do next without using technical terms.
- [ ] **Verify Social Cards:** I will check if the social sharing cards are generated correctly and look good. I want to be proud to share my family blog link.
- [ ] **Audit "Getting Started" Guide:** I will do a line-by-line review of the README's "Getting Started" section to identify every instance of jargon that would stop me from installing Egregora.

## Dependencies

- **Curator & Forge:** I need their visual updates and empty state changes to be ready for review.
- **Lore:** I'll check the "Deep Knowledge" docs to see if they explain things simply, or if they need a "Translation for Humans".

## Context

Sprint 2 is heavy on "Refactoring" and "Architecture". My role is to be the voice of the user who doesn't care about the architecture, but cares deeply about the *feeling* of the product. If the refactors make the installation harder or the site slower, I need to raise the flag.

## Expected Deliverables

1.  **Feedback Report: Empty State:** A journal entry reviewing the emotional tone and clarity of the new empty state.
2.  **Feedback Report: Social Cards:** Screenshots or descriptions of how the social cards look (or don't look).
3.  **"Jargon-Free" README Proposal:** A markup of the README with suggested simplifications for the installation process.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Refactors break "Magic" features | Medium | High | I will manually check a generated site to ensure Profiles and Memory Links still appear. |
| Technical focus overshadows UX | High | Medium | I will be loud in my feedback and daily journal about the user experience. |

## Proposed Collaborations

- **With Curator:** I can help write the copy for the "Empty State" to ensure it sounds like a human speaking.
- **With Forge:** I can provide feedback on the visual style of the social cards.
