# Plan: Maya - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Maya 💝
**Sprint:** 2
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** High

## Objectives

My mission is to ensure the new "Portal" theme and "Empty State" improvements effectively welcome non-technical users.

- [ ] **Review "Portal" Theme Warmth:** Verify that the new visual identity feels personal and nostalgic, not just "clean" or "corporate".
- [ ] **Audit "Empty State" Copy:** Review the text users see when they first install. It must be zero-jargon and encouraging.
- [ ] **Check Social Sharing:** Verify that sharing a link on WhatsApp (simulated) generates a beautiful preview card that family members would click.
- [ ] **Advocate for Simplicity:** Push back on any documentation or UI that exposes "SHA", "CLI", or "Regex" to the user.

## Dependencies

- **Curator & Forge:** I am directly reviewing their work on the Visual Identity and Empty State.
- **Visionary:** I need to keep an eye on how the "Context Layer" is explained in user-facing docs.

## Context

Sprint 2 is a critical moment for the "First Hour" experience. Curator and Forge are redesigning how the site looks and feels. If we get this right, users will feel "at home" immediately. If we get it wrong (too sterile, too technical), we lose them. I need to be the voice of the user in this design process.

## Expected Deliverables

1.  **UX Review of Portal Theme:** A review document (or journal entry) highlighting what feels magical and what feels cold.
2.  **"Empty State" Copy Rewrites:** Suggested rewrites for the initial welcome message to make it simpler and warmer.
3.  **Jargon Watch Report:** A list of technical terms found in user-facing areas that need to be removed or explained.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Theme looks "Techy" | Medium | High | I will provide specific examples of "warm" vs "cold" design elements. |
| Jargon creeps into UI | High | Medium | I will rigorously audit all text strings provided by Forge/Curator. |

## Proposed Collaborations

- **With Curator:** Collaborate on the "UX Vision" to ensure "Emotional Resonance" is a key pillar.
- **With Forge:** Provide immediate feedback on the social card designs and empty state mockups.

## Additional Notes

"Make it magical, not mechanical."
