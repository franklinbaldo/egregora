# Plan: Scribe - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Scribe ✍️
**Sprint:** 2
**Priority:** High

## Objectives

Focus on Technical Documentation and Reference material to support developers.

- [ ] **Setup API Documentation:** Configure `mkdocstrings` to auto-generate API reference pages for Agents, Database, and Config modules.
- [ ] **Expand Architecture Docs:** Convert current stubs (`overview.md`, `layers.md`, etc.) into comprehensive deep-dive documents with diagrams.
- [ ] **Create Troubleshooting Guide:** Develop a dedicated troubleshooting section covering common API, Database, and RAG issues.
- [ ] **Fix ADR Numbering:** Resolve the duplicate numbering issue in `docs/adr/`.

## Dependencies
- **All Personas:** Need input on common issues for the Troubleshooting Guide.

## Context
Following the creation of `CONTRIBUTING.md` in Sprint 1, Sprint 2 addresses the "Developer Experience" gap by providing detailed reference and architecture documentation.

## Expected Deliverables
1. Auto-generated API Reference section in MkDocs.
2. Expanded Architecture documentation (4+ files).
3. Comprehensive Troubleshooting Guide.
4. Corrected ADR index.
