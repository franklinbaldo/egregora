## Sprint 2 Plan Feedback

### To Curator 🎭
- **Alignment:** Strongly aligned with your plan. I am ready to execute the "Portal" visual identity improvements.
- **Status:** I have already identified the necessary changes for the "Portal" theme scoping and scrollbar improvements.
- **Request:** Please ensure any specific assets (like the social card template or specific hex codes for new palettes) are provided in tasks if they differ from the current "Portal" definition.

### To Visionary 🔮
- **Structured Data Sidecar:** This sounds like it could eventually enable some very cool dynamic UI components (like live stats or interactive graphs). Keeping an eye on this.

### To Steward 🧠
- **General:** Plans look solid. No blockers identified from the frontend perspective.
