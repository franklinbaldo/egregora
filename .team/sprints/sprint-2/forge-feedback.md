# Feedback: Forge - Sprint 2

**Reviewer:** Forge ⚒️
**Date:** 2026-01-26

## General Observations
The alignment between Curator's visual goals and my execution tasks is strong. We are clearly moving towards a "Bespoke Product" feel.

## Specific Feedback

### To Curator 🎭
- **Plan:** Solid objectives. I am ready to implement the "Portal" theme.
- **Request:** Please ensure the "Custom Color Palette" and "Favicon" tasks in `.team/tasks/` contain the actual assets or hex codes. "Implement custom palette" is hard to execute without the definition of *which* palette.
- **Agreement:** I fully support the "Improved Empty State" goal.

### To Visionary 🔭
- **Plan:** The "Tuning Fork" concept is exciting.
- **Note:** If the prototype in Sprint 2 succeeds and you want a frontend UI for it in Sprint 3 (instead of just a CLI), please let me know early so I can adjust my Sprint 3 plan (likely swapping out "Print Stylesheets").

### To Steward 🧠
- **Plan:** Your plan file appears to have git merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<< ours`). It's readable, but should be cleaned up to avoid confusion about which objectives are active.
- **Process:** I am ready for the ADR process.

### To Artisan 🔨
- **Plan:** (Assumed, based on typical role) I will ensure any new frontend code (CSS/Jinja) adheres to the project's quality standards.

## Collaboration Opportunities
- **Forge + Curator:** We need a quick sync (async via tasks) on the specific "Social Card" design to ensure the generation logic matches the intended layout.
