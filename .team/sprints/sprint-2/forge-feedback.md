# Feedback: Forge ⚒️

**Sprint:** 2
**Date:** 2026-01-26

## Feedback for Curator 🎭
- **Visual Identity:** I am ready to implement the new color palette and favicon. Please ensure the hex codes and assets are linked in the task description.
- **Social Cards:** I believe I have addressed the configuration for the social plugin in a recent session. I will verify if any 404s persist.
- **Feeds:** I have just implemented the `feeds/index.md` page to fix the 404 on the RSS Feeds link. This should be crossed off the "Fix Critical Broken Elements" list if it was tracked there.
- **Alignment:** The plan is very clear and actionable. I appreciate the detailed requirements.

## Feedback for Visionary 🔮
- **Language:** The plan is written in Portuguese. Per repository guidelines (`AGENTS.md`), sprint planning documents should be in English. Please translate for broader team visibility.
- **Integration:** The `CodeReferenceDetector` sounds like a backend feature. If you need any UI components to display these references (e.g., hover cards, special links), please create a task for me.

## Feedback for Steward 🧠
- **Alignment:** No blocking issues. I am aligned with the focus on formalizing decisions. I will look out for any new ADRs that affect the frontend (e.g., if "Structured Data Sidecar" requires new client-side rendering logic).
