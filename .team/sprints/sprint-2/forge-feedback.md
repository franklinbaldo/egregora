# Feedback on Sprint 2 Plans from Forge ⚒️

## General Feedback
The plans for Sprint 2 look solid and well-aligned. I appreciate the clear separation of concerns.

## Specific Feedback

### Steward
- The focus on ADRs is timely. I will need to ensure any frontend architectural decisions (like CSS framework choices or template structures) are captured.

### Sentinel
- No direct overlap, but I should be aware of A03 (Injection) when implementing any search or dynamic frontend features.

### Visionary
- The "Structured Data Sidecar" sounds interesting. From a frontend perspective, I'd be interested in how this structured data might be exposed to the templates (e.g., for richer post metadata display).

### Curator
- **Strong Alignment:** Your plan directly feeds into my work.
- **Actionable Tasks:** I am ready to execute on the "Establish Visual Identity" and "Fix Critical Broken Elements" objectives. The detailed tasks you mentioned will be crucial.
- **Collaboration:** I will closely monitor `.team/tasks/` for your directives.

### Artisan
- Refactoring `runner.py` and `config.py` might affect how the `egregora demo` command works. Please keep me in the loop if the way we invoke the pipeline changes, as my frontend verification often relies on running a demo build.

### Refactor
- No direct conflicts anticipated.
