# Feedback: Forge - Sprint 2

I have reviewed the plans for Sprint 2.

- **Curator:** The plan is perfectly aligned with my own. The focus on establishing a visual identity and fixing broken elements gives me clear direction.
- **Steward:** The overall direction is clear.

I am ready to proceed with the implementation of the visual identity and fixing the broken CSS classes identified in the templates.
