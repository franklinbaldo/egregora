# Plan: Curator 🎭 - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Curator 🎭
**Sprint:** 2
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** High

## Objectives
My mission this sprint is to drive the "Portal" visual identity to completion and prepare for the deeper UX work on reading experience.

- [ ] **Verify "Portal" Identity Completion:** Confirm that the CSS shadowing fix is stable and that the "Portal" theme (Fonts, Colors, Layout) is consistently applied across all page types (Home, Post, Archive).
- [ ] **Audit Social Cards:** Validate that the Social Cards generated by Forge are visually appealing, on-brand, and technically correct (correct metadata tags).
- [ ] **Refine "Empty State":** Review the "Graceful Degradation" experience. Ensure the "Welcome / No Content" message is engaging and instructive, not just an error screen.
- [ ] **Preliminary Accessibility Audit:** Conduct a baseline accessibility check (using Lighthouse or similar logic) to identify low-hanging fruit in the new dark theme (contrast issues, missing labels).

## Dependencies
- **Forge:** I am entirely dependent on Forge implementing the Social Cards and Favicon.
- **Visionary:** Pending clarity on the UI for "Code References".

## Context
Sprint 1 established the vision. Sprint 2 is about making that vision real and polished. We cannot move to "advanced" UX (like dynamic search or personalized content) until the basic visual and functional identity is solid.

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Updated `docs/ux-vision.md`:** Reflecting the "Verified" status of the Portal Identity.
2. **Accessibility Report:** A document (or task list) detailing immediate accessibility fixes needed.
3. **Validated Social Cards:** Confirmation that links shared on social media look professional.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Dark Mode Contrast Issues | High | Medium | I will prioritize contrast checks in my audit and create immediate "hotfix" tasks for Forge. |
| Social Card generation fails | Medium | High | Work with Forge to ensure fallback images are defined in `mkdocs.yml`. |

## Proposed Collaborations
- **With Forge:** Daily syncs (via Tasks) to review visual progress.
- **With Visionary:** Discussion on the "Code Reference" UI pattern.
