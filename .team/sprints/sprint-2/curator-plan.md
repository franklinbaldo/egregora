# Plan: Curator 🎭 - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Curator
**Sprint:** 2
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** High

## Objectives
<<<<<<< HEAD
My mission this sprint is to drive the "Portal" visual identity to completion and prepare for the deeper UX work on reading experience.

<<<<<<< HEAD
- [ ] **Verify "Portal" Identity Completion:** Confirm that the CSS shadowing fix is stable and that the "Portal" theme (Fonts, Colors, Layout) is consistently applied across all page types (Home, Post, Archive).
- [ ] **Audit Social Cards:** Validate that the Social Cards generated by Forge are visually appealing, on-brand, and technically correct (correct metadata tags).
- [ ] **Refine "Empty State":** Review the "Graceful Degradation" experience. Ensure the "Welcome / No Content" message is engaging and instructive, not just an error screen.
- [ ] **Preliminary Accessibility Audit:** Conduct a baseline accessibility check (using Lighthouse or similar logic) to identify low-hanging fruit in the new dark theme (contrast issues, missing labels).

## Dependencies
- **Forge:** I am entirely dependent on Forge implementing the Social Cards and Favicon.
- **Visionary:** Pending clarity on the UI for "Code References".

## Context
Sprint 1 established the vision. Sprint 2 is about making that vision real and polished. We cannot move to "advanced" UX (like dynamic search or personalized content) until the basic visual and functional identity is solid.
=======
Establish a solid UX baseline by fixing critical visual and functional bugs.

- [ ] Oversee the consolidation of CSS files to resolve the shadowing issue.
- [ ] Oversee the implementation of the Feeds index page to fix the 404 error.
- [ ] Verify the "Portal" vision integrity after CSS consolidation.

## Dependencies

- **Forge:** Must complete task `20260125-140000-ux-consolidate-css-shadowing.md`.
- **Forge:** Must complete task `20260126-1000-ux-implement-feeds-page.md`.

## Context

The current CSS architecture is fragmented, causing the "Portal" theme styles (in `docs/`) to shadow the structural fixes (in `overrides/`). This results in a broken layout on the homepage. Additionally, the "RSS Feeds" link on the homepage leads to a 404 page, which is a poor user experience.

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Updated `docs/ux-vision.md`:** Reflecting the "Verified" status of the Portal Identity.
2. **Accessibility Report:** A document (or task list) detailing immediate accessibility fixes needed.
3. **Validated Social Cards:** Confirmation that links shared on social media look professional.
=======
My mission is to ensure the "Portal" visual identity is fully realized and that the user experience is polished, accessible, and robust.

<<<<<<< HEAD
- [ ] **Oversee Portal Implementation:** Direct the `forge` persona to complete the visual implementation of the Portal theme (Social Cards, Favicon consolidation).
- [ ] **Accessibility Audit:** Conduct a thorough accessibility audit (WCAG 2.1 AA target) of the new theme and create tasks for any violations found.
- [ ] **Empty State UX:** Refine the "Empty State" experience (when no content is generated) to be informative and "graceful" rather than broken.
- [ ] **Maintain Vision:** Continuously update `docs/ux-vision.md` as the "Single Source of Truth" for design decisions.

## Dependencies
- **Forge:** Implementation of the visual changes.
- **Maya:** Input on the emotional/copy aspects of the Empty State.

## Context
Sprint 2 is the "Structure & Polish" sprint. While others focus on backend structure, I am the guardian of the "Polish". A solid backend is useless if the frontend feels broken or cheap.

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Updated `docs/ux-vision.md`:** Reflecting the final state of the Portal theme.
2. **Accessibility Report:** A journal entry or document detailing the accessibility status and any required fixes.
3. **Task Generation:** Precision tasks for `forge` (technical fixes) and `maya` (content/copy) based on my audits.
>>>>>>> origin/pr/2881
=======
1.  **Consolidated CSS:** A single source of truth for styles that correctly applies both the "Portal" theme and the layout structure.
2.  **Feeds Page:** A working `docs/feeds/index.md` page that lists available RSS/JSON feeds.
3.  **Verified Demo:** A `demo` site generated via `egregora demo` that passes visual inspection.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
| Dark Mode Contrast Issues | High | Medium | I will prioritize contrast checks in my audit and create immediate "hotfix" tasks for Forge. |
| Social Card generation fails | Medium | High | Work with Forge to ensure fallback images are defined in `mkdocs.yml`. |
=======
| CSS conflicts persist | Medium | High | Require Forge to verify with specific screenshots/DOM inspection. |
| Scaffolding logic fails | Low | Medium | Review scaffolding code changes carefully. |
>>>>>>> origin/pr/2842

## Proposed Collaborations
- **With Forge:** Daily syncs (via Tasks) to review visual progress.
- **With Visionary:** Discussion on the "Code Reference" UI pattern.
=======
| Accessibility requires major markup changes | Medium | Medium | I will identify these early and create high-priority tasks for `forge`. |
| "Portal" theme conflicts with standard MkDocs plugins | Low | Low | I will test standard plugins (search, toc) to ensure they are still usable. |

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Proposed Collaborations
- **With Forge:** Tight feedback loop on visual implementation.
- **With Maya:** Collaboration on the "voice" of the interface.
>>>>>>> origin/pr/2881
=======
- **With Forge:** Direct feedback loop on the CSS consolidation to ensure the "Portal" aesthetic is preserved.
