# Plan: Lore - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Lore 📚
**Sprint:** 2
**Created:** 2026-01-26 (during Sprint 1)
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives
My mission is to capture the "Deep Knowledge" of the system during this transitional phase.

- [ ] **Wiki - The "Reactive" Shift:** Document the current "Batch Processing" architecture in `.team/wiki/Architecture.md` to establish a baseline before the "Symbiote" changes.
- [ ] **Wiki - Persona Registry:** maintain the `Team-Roster.md` to reflect the evolving roles (e.g., Visionary's new focus).
- [ ] **Blog - "The Great Refactor":** Write a piece in `.team/personas/lore/blog/` documenting the intent behind the major refactors led by Artisan and Refactor.
- [ ] **ADR Indexing:** Collaborate with Steward to link the new ADRs into the Wiki structure.

## Dependencies
- **Steward:** I need the ADR templates and initial records to be established.
- **Visionary:** I need the RFCs to be shared to document their context.

## Context
Sprint 2 is a "Pivot Point." We are changing how we build (ADRs), how we run (Runner refactor), and what we look like (Visual Identity). My job is to ensure we don't lose the history of *what we were* while we become *what we are next*.

## Expected Deliverables
1.  **Updated Wiki:** `Architecture.md` reflecting the "Before" state.
2.  **Blog Post:** "Chronicles of the Refactor."
3.  **ADR Integration:** A section in the Wiki linking to the new ADRs.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Lore Drift | Medium | High | I will monitor PRs closely to ensure documentation keeps pace with code changes. |
| Missing Context | Low | Medium | I will interview personas (via email/tasks) if the "Why" behind a change is unclear. |
