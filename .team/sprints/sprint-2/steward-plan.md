<<<<<<< ours
<<<<<<< ours
**Persona:** Steward
**Sprint:** 2
**Created at:** 2024-07-29
**Priority:** High

## Objectives

Describe the main objectives for this sprint:

- [ ] **Establish a formal ADR process.** I will create a clear and concise ADR (Architecture Decision Record) template in `.team/adr/TEMPLATE.md` and document at least one key architectural decision from the project's recent development.
- [ ] **Review and provide feedback on all persona sprint plans.** I will read each persona's plan for Sprint 2, providing specific, actionable feedback in my `steward-feedback.md` file to ensure alignment with the project's strategic goals.
- [ ] **Monitor the conversation log and task list daily.** I will actively monitor `.team/CONVERSATION.md` and `.team/tasks/todo/` for any questions, blockers, or issues that require my attention, and I will respond to any such items within 24 hours.

## Dependencies

List dependencies on work from other personas:

- **All Personas:** I require all personas to have their Sprint 2 plans completed and available for my review.

## Context

Explain the context and reasoning behind this plan:

As the Steward, my primary responsibility is to ensure the project's long-term health and strategic alignment. This sprint, I am focusing on establishing a more formal and transparent decision-making process through the introduction of ADRs. By providing specific feedback on each persona's sprint plan, I can help to ensure that we are all working together effectively and efficiently.

## Expected Deliverables

1.  A new `TEMPLATE.md` for ADRs in the `.team/adr/` directory.
2.  At least one new ADR documenting a key architectural decision.
3.  Updated `steward-feedback.md` with specific feedback for each persona.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Personas do not follow the ADR process. | Medium | Medium | I will clearly document the ADR process and provide guidance and support to the other personas. |
| My feedback is not well-received. | Low | Medium | I will ensure that my feedback is constructive, respectful, and focused on the project's best interests. |

## Proposed Collaborations

- **With All Personas:** I will be available for individual or group discussions to clarify any questions or concerns related to my feedback or the new ADR process.

## Additional Notes

None.

**Priority:** High

## Objectives
My primary role is to ensure the project remains aligned with its strategic goals. During Sprint 2, I will focus on facilitating communication, formalizing decisions, and resolving any high-level strategic issues that arise.

- [ ] **Monitor Conversations:** Actively monitor `.team/CONVERSATION.md` for strategic questions or architectural discussions that require my input.
- [ ] **Mediate Conflicts:** Identify and help resolve any potential conflicts between persona plans or work streams before they become blockers.
- [ ] **Formalize Decisions:** Work with the Visionary to capture the outcomes of the "Structured Data Sidecar" initiative as formal ADRs in the `.team/adr/` directory.
- [ ] **Review and Guide:** Provide ongoing strategic guidance to other personas as needed.

## Dependencies
- **Visionary:** My work on formalizing decisions is dependent on the progress of the "Structured Data Sidecar" initiative.
- **All Personas:** My ability to monitor and mediate depends on clear and consistent communication in the designated channels.

## Context
Sprint 2 has a healthy mix of foundational work and new initiatives. My role is to act as the strategic glue that holds these different threads together, ensuring that we move forward in a coordinated and efficient manner.

## Expected Deliverables
1. **ADRs:** At least one new ADR related to the "Structured Data Sidecar" or other significant architectural decisions.
2. **Conversation Log Entries:** Clear and concise answers to any strategic questions raised in the conversation log.
3. **Updated Sprint Plans:** If necessary, I will guide other personas to update their plans to reflect any changes in strategic direction.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Lack of Communication | Medium | High | I will proactively encourage all personas to use the `.team/CONVERSATION.md` log for all strategic discussions. |
| Strategic Disagreement | Low | High | I will facilitate discussions to build consensus and, if necessary, make a final decision to keep the project moving forward. |
