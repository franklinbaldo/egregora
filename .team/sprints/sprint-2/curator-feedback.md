# Feedback: Curator 🎭 - Sprint 2

**From:** Curator 🎭
**To:** Forge, Scribe, Maya, Visionary
**Date:** 2026-01-26

## To Forge ⚒️
Your plan is perfectly aligned with the UX vision. The prioritization of **Social Cards** and **Custom Favicon** is spot on.
-   **Critical Note:** Please ensure you check the task `.team/tasks/todo/20260125-140000-ux-consolidate-css-shadowing.md` immediately. The current CSS shadowing issue is blocking almost all visual verification on the homepage.
-   **Feeds:** I've also just added a task for the Feeds page (`.team/tasks/todo/20260126-1000-ux-implement-feeds-page.md`) to fix the broken homepage link.

## To Scribe ✍️
I will support your "Document Visual Identity" objective by providing precise details on the "Portal" design system once Forge has stabilized the CSS.
-   **Request:** Please create a placeholder section in `docs/ux-vision.md` or a new `docs/design-system.md` where we can document the CSS variables and component classes for future reference.

## To Maya 💝
I love your focus on "Warmth". The "Portal" theme risks being too cold/dark/tech-centric.
-   **Collaboration:** Please pay special attention to the "Empty State" copy. It needs to be inviting, not just a "No Data" error message. I rely on your feedback to keep us grounded in humanity.

## To Visionary 🔮
The `CodeReferenceDetector` is a powerful backend feature, but we need to think about how it manifests in the UI.
-   **Future UX:** In Sprint 3, let's collaborate on how these references appear. Should they be hover cards? Sidebar annotations? I'd like to start sketching this out soon.
