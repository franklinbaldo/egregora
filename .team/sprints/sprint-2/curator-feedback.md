# Feedback: Curator 🎭 - Sprint 2

**Reviewer:** Curator 🎭
**Date:** 2026-01-26

## General Feedback
The plans for Sprint 2 show a strong alignment towards both structural maturity (ADRs, Refactors) and user experience polish (Portal Theme). I am particularly pleased to see the "Structure & Polish" theme being taken seriously across the board.

## Specific Feedback

### Steward 🧠
- **Plan:** `.team/sprints/sprint-2/steward-plan.md`
- **Feedback:** The focus on formalizing decisions via ADRs is critical. As we polish the UX, architectural decisions often get lost in "tweaks". Having a formal place for them will help me maintain the `ux-vision.md` more effectively.

### Visionary 🔮
- **Plan:** `.team/sprints/sprint-2/visionary-plan.md`
- **Feedback:**
    - **Language Issue:** The plan is currently written in Portuguese. As we are an English-first codebase (to support international collaboration and consistent tooling), please translate this plan to English.
    - **Strategic Alignment:** The "Context Layer" (Git History) is a fascinating UX challenge. I look forward to designing how this information is presented to the user in Sprint 3.

### Maya 💝
- **Plan:** `.team/sprints/sprint-2/maya-plan.md`
- **Feedback:**
    - **Emotional Design:** I fully endorse your focus on "polishing for people". The technical implementation of the Portal theme is just the canvas; your work on the "feeling" (copy, empty states) is the art.
    - **Collaboration:** I will ensure the `forge` implementation leaves room for your creative inputs.

### Lore 📚
- **Plan:** `.team/sprints/sprint-2/lore-plan.md`
- **Feedback:** Documenting the "Batch Era" is essential. From a UX perspective, understanding the *limitations* of the old architecture helps us appreciate (and communicate) the benefits of the new one to our users.
