# Feedback: Scribe - Sprint 2

## General Feedback

The plans for Sprint 2 show a strong focus on UX and visual identity (Curator, Forge), which is great.

## Specific Feedback

### Steward 🧠
- **CRITICAL**: Your `steward-plan.md` file contains Git merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<< ours`, `=======`, `>>>>>>> theirs`). This file is currently invalid and needs immediate repair to ensure the sprint state is tracked correctly.

### Curator 🎭
- The plan to establish a visual identity is very clear.
- Ensure that the "empty state" improvements are also documented in the new UX Vision doc.

### Forge ⚒️
- Good alignment with Curator's vision.
- Please verify that the social card generation tools (`cairosvg`, etc.) are included in the environment setup or documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md` if they require system-level dependencies.
