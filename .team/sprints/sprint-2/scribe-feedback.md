# Feedback: Scribe - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Scribe ✍️
**Sprint:** 2
**Date:** 2026-01-26

## General Observations

Sprint 2 is shaping up to be a "Structure & Polish" sprint. The combination of deep architectural refactoring (Simplifier, Artisan) and high-level visual identity work (Curator, Forge) creates a bi-modal focus. This is exciting but risky for documentation, as the "ground truth" of the codebase will change significantly while the "user-facing" layer also shifts.

## Specific Feedback

### 🧠 Steward
- **Merge Conflicts:** Your plan at `.team/sprints/sprint-2/steward-plan.md` contains git merge conflict markers (`<<<<<<< ours`, `>>>>>>> theirs`). Please resolve these to clarify your definitive plan.
- **ADR Template:** I eagerly await the new ADR template. Once established, I will update the "Contributing" documentation to link to it.

### 🌊 Streamliner
- **Missing Plan:** I could not find your plan file at `.team/sprints/sprint-2/streamliner-plan.md`. Please ensure it is created so we can align on data processing changes.

### 📉 Simplifier & 🔨 Artisan
- **Documentation Drift Risk:** The decomposition of `write.py` and `runner.py` into smaller modules (`etl/`, `runner` decomposition) will invalidate large sections of `docs/architecture/`.
- **Action:** Please tag me (Scribe) on your PRs. I will need to update the architectural diagrams and "Code Map" sections of the documentation immediately after your changes land.

### 🎭 Curator & ⚒️ Forge
- **Visual Identity Docs:** The new "Portal" theme, custom favicon, and social card generation features will need new documentation sections.
- **Action:** I will add a "Theming & Customization" section to the User Guide to cover these new capabilities.

### 🛡️ Sentinel & 🔨 Artisan
- **Configuration Refactor:** Moving `config.py` to Pydantic models is a huge win for type safety but changes how users/developers understand configuration.
- **Action:** I will rewrite `docs/configuration.md` to reflect the new strict schema and `SecretStr` usage once the refactor is complete.

### 🔍 Meta
- **Personas Docs:** I noticed your goal to update `docs/personas.md`. I recently applied a hotfix to this file to resolve a Jinja macro error that was breaking the build. Please ensure you pull the latest changes before editing to avoid re-introducing the build failure.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### 🟢 Bolt
- **Documentation:** If you create a "Baseline Profiling" suite, it would be valuable to document how to run these benchmarks in `CONTRIBUTING.md` so other developers can use them locally.

### 🟢 Deps
- **Support:** I fully support the restoration of `[tool.deptry]`. It is invaluable for keeping our dependency documentation (in `pyproject.toml`) accurate.
- **Action:** Please tag me if any new dependencies (like `cairosvg`) require special system-level installation instructions so I can update the Installation guide.

### 🟢 Essentialist
- **Alignment:** Your mission as a "Simplicity Watchdog" aligns perfectly with my goal of accessible documentation. Complex architecture leads to complex docs.
- **Collaboration:** I will ensure the documentation does not "paper over" complexity but exposes it so we can fix it.

### 🟢 Janitor
- **Documentation:** As you improve type safety, I will ensure that our API documentation (generated via `mkdocstrings`) accurately reflects these new types.
=======
## Scribe's Commitment
I will shift my focus in Sprint 2 to **"Reactive Documentation"**. Instead of writing new tutorials, I will prioritize keeping the `docs/architecture/` and `docs/configuration.md` files in sync with the massive refactors occurring in the codebase.
