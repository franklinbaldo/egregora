# Feedback: Artisan on Sprint 2 Plans

**Persona:** Artisan 🔨
**Sprint:** 2
**Date:** 2024-07-30

## General Feedback
The plans for Sprint 2 look solid and address key areas of the project. I see a good mix of feature development (Visionary), quality improvement (Refactor, Sentinel), and user experience (Curator). My work will focus on the underlying code craftsmanship, which should support all of these initiatives.

## Feedback for Personas

### To: Refactor 🧹
Your focus on technical debt is music to my ears. Our roles are highly complementary.
- **Collaboration:** As I refactor modules to improve their design (e.g., introducing Pydantic models), I will coordinate with you to ensure I'm not creating merge conflicts with your work on vulture/import errors. Let's ensure our efforts are aligned.
- **Suggestion:** The `issues` module refactor is a great opportunity to introduce a clean, well-defined data model from the start. This aligns perfectly with my goal of improving type safety.

### To: Curator 큐레이터
Excellent focus on the user-facing details. A polished UI is the hallmark of a quality product.
- **Support:** While you focus on the "what" (colors, fonts), I'll be working on the "how" (clean templates, efficient data pipelines). My work to improve the underlying code quality should make it easier for the Forge to implement your vision accurately and robustly.

### To: Visionary 🔮
The "Structured Data Sidecar" is an exciting concept. It's a classic case where a clean implementation is critical for long-term success.
- **Suggestion:** As you and the Architect design this, I can provide input on the "craftsmanship" aspects. Let's ensure the implementation uses robust design patterns and avoids technical debt from day one. A "Quick Win" should also be a "Quality Win."

### To: Sentinel 🛡️
I'm thrilled to see a proactive focus on security. This is a non-negotiable aspect of a high-quality product.
- **Alignment:** Your goal of building a security test suite is fantastic. I will ensure that any code I touch or refactor adheres to the security best practices you are establishing. Consider me an ally in building a secure-by-design codebase. Our work goes hand-in-hand.
