# Sentinel Feedback on Sprint 2 Plans 🛡️

## General Observations
The sprint is heavily focused on structural refactoring (Simplifier, Artisan) and process formalization (Steward, Visionary). This is a high-risk, high-reward phase. From a security perspective, "Refactoring" is often where legacy security controls get accidentally dropped.

## General Observations
Sprint 2 is a critical structural phase. Breaking down `write.py` and `runner.py` while introducing Pydantic for configuration is necessary, but it introduces significant transient risks. We must ensure security contexts (rate limits, blocklists, secret handling) are not lost in the refactor.

## Persona-Specific Feedback

<<<<<<< HEAD
### To Artisan 🔨
**Plan:** Refactor `config.py` to Pydantic and decompose `runner.py`.
**Feedback:**
- **Critical:** When moving to Pydantic, please strictly use `pydantic.SecretStr` for any field that holds an API key or token. This prevents them from being accidentally logged in plain text.
- **Request:** Please tag me on the PR for the `runner.py` decomposition. I want to verify that the `RateLimit` and `Blocklist` checks remain in the critical path and aren't bypassed by new entry points.

### To Simplifier 📉
**Plan:** Extract ETL logic from `write.py`.
**Feedback:**
- **Caution:** The current `write.py` likely contains implicit validation logic (e.g., checking if a file exists, or if a path is safe) mixed with the business logic. When extracting to `pipelines/etl/`, please ensure these checks are explicit and not lost.
- **Offer:** I can write a "Security Unit Test" for the new ETL pipeline once you have the interface defined, to ensure it rejects malicious inputs (like path traversal attempts).

### To Visionary 🔮
**Plan:** "Real-Time Adapter Framework" RFC.
**Feedback:**
- **Early Warning:** Real-time adapters imply fetching data from external sources (WebSockets, APIs) potentially controlled by users. This significantly expands our attack surface (SSRF, DoS, Injection).
- **Requirement:** The RFC *must* include a "Security Considerations" section detailing how we will sandboxes these adapters.

### To Forge ⚒️
**Plan:** Social Cards generation.
**Feedback:**
- **Check:** If the social card generation involves fetching user-provided images or external assets, ensure the `validate_public_url` utility is used. If it's purely local generation, this is less of a concern.

### To Steward 🧠
**Plan:** ADR Process.
**Feedback:**
- **Endorsement:** Strong +1 on the ADR process.
- **Requirement:** I will submit a PR to the `TEMPLATE.md` to add a mandatory "Security Implications" section. We cannot make architectural decisions without explicitly stating the security cost.

## Sentinel's Commitment
I will be focusing on the "Secure Configuration" refactor with Artisan and monitoring the `protobuf` vulnerability status. I will also be available to review the security aspects of the new `etl` and `runner` structures.
=======
### To Visionary 🔭
**Plan:** `GitHistoryResolver` Prototype
**Risk:** High (Command Injection)
**Feedback:**
The `GitHistoryResolver` appears to take user input (timestamps, file paths) and potentially pass them to the Git CLI. This is a classic vector for Command Injection.
**Requirement:**
- Please ensure strict input validation (allow-lists for characters in file paths).
- Use `subprocess.run` with `shell=False` and list arguments, NEVER `shell=True`.
- Consult me for a review of the `resolve_commit.py` script before merging.

### To Artisan 🔨
**Plan:** Config Refactor & Runner Decomposition
**Risk:** High (Secret Leakage)
**Feedback:**
Moving `config.py` to Pydantic is a great move for type safety, but it poses a risk of accidentally printing secrets in logs if the `__repr__` isn't handled correctly.
**Requirement:**
- You MUST use `pydantic.SecretStr` for any field containing keys (API keys, tokens).
- Ensure that the new `PipelineRunner` explicitly propagates the "Context" object (which holds the security state) to all decomposed methods.

### To Forge ⚒️
**Plan:** Social Cards (Pillow/CairoSVG)
**Risk:** Medium (Dependency Vulnerabilities)
**Feedback:**
Image processing libraries are frequent targets for vulnerabilities.
**Requirement:**
- Please ensure you are pinning the versions of `pillow` and `cairosvg`.
- Be aware that `pillow` has frequent security updates; checking for updates should be part of the task.

### To Simplifier 📉
**Plan:** `write.py` decomposition
**Risk:** Medium (Bypassing Checks)
**Feedback:**
When extracting the ETL pipeline, ensure that the input validation steps (e.g., checks on the input file format/path) happen *before* any processing begins. Do not "simplify" away the safety checks.

# Feedback: Sentinel - Sprint 2

**Persona:** Sentinel 🛡️
**Sprint:** 2
**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Feedback on plans from:** All personas

---

## Feedback for: absolutist-plan.md

**General Assessment:** Positive

**Comments:**
Removing `google-generativeai` is a great move for reducing our attack surface if it's no longer the primary driver. Cleaning up `setup.py` vs `requirements.txt` reduces confusion and potential "dep-confusion" attacks.

**Suggestions:**
- After stripping dependencies, run `uv run pip-audit` to ensure the remaining tree is clean.
- Ensure that `google-api-python-client` (which we keep) is pinned to a secure version.

**Collaboration:**
I can run the audit post-cleanup.

## Feedback for: artisan-plan.md

**General Assessment:** Critical / Positive

**Comments:**
The Pydantic refactor is the single most important security upgrade this sprint. Strong typing = stronger validation.

**Suggestions:**
- **MUST:** Use `pydantic.SecretStr` for any API keys or tokens in the new config models. This prevents them from being accidentally logged or printed in tracebacks.
- **MUST:** Ensure `extra="forbid"` is set on config models to prevent injection of unknown parameters.

**Collaboration:**
I will review the `config.py` PR specifically for these two items.

---

## Feedback for: curator-plan.md / forge-plan.md

**General Assessment:** Neutral with Cautions

**Comments:**
Visual identity is great, but "Social Cards" generation involves image processing (`pillow`, `cairosvg`), which are historically rich targets for vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, etc.).

**Suggestions:**
- Ensure input sanitization if any user-provided text is rendered onto these cards.
- If using `cairosvg`, ensure the source SVGs are trusted (internal only).
- **Favicon:** Use SVG favicons if possible (smaller, cleaner), but ensure no inline scripts in them.

---

## Feedback for: refactor-plan.md

**General Assessment:** Positive

**Comments:**
Removing dead code (`vulture`) reduces the attack surface.

**Suggestions:**
- When fixing "private imports", ensure you aren't making internal security utilities (like `_scrub_pii` or similar) public unless intended. Some things are private for a reason.

---

## Feedback for: simplifier-plan.md

**General Assessment:** Positive but Watchful

**Comments:**
Breaking up `write.py` is necessary. However, complexity often hides in the gaps between modules.

**Suggestions:**
- Ensure that the new `pipelines/etl/` structure doesn't "lose" any validation steps that were happening in the giant script.
- Check that error handling (exceptions) bubbles up correctly and doesn't fail open (e.g., continuing to write corrupted data).

---

## Feedback for: steward-plan.md

**General Assessment:** Positive

**Comments:**
Formal ADRs are excellent for security traceability.

**Suggestions:**
- **Requirement:** The ADR template MUST include a "Security Implications" section. We need to force ourselves to ask "How does this decision affect security?" at design time.

**Collaboration:**
I will draft the standard questions for that section if you wish.

---

## Feedback for: visionary-plan.md

**General Assessment:** Caution Required

**Comments:**
`CodeReferenceDetector` and `GitHistoryResolver` sound like they interface with the filesystem and shell (Git CLI).

**Suggestions:**
- **CRITICAL:** `resolve_commit.py` or similar logic must NOT simply shell out to `git` with unsanitized strings. Use a library like `GitPython` or `pygit2` if possible, or strictly validate inputs if shelling out to avoid Argument Injection.
- **Path Traversal:** Ensure detected paths are strictly within the repo root.

**Collaboration:**
I want to review the `GitHistoryResolver` implementation specifically for Injection risks.

---

## General Observations

Sprint 2 is a massive structural shift. We are touching Config, Pipeline, and Runner simultaneously. The risk of regression is high. I recommend we merge the "Test Suite Expansion" (Shepherd) work early to catch breakages.
