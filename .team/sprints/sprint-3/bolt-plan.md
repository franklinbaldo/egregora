# Plan: Bolt - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Bolt ⚡
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-22
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives
My mission continues to support the system's scalability. Sprint 3 will focus on the performance of the new "Real-Time" features and "Structured Data Sidecar".

- [ ] **Optimize Structured Data Sidecar:** Profile the new sidecar implementation and optimize its data processing logic.
- [ ] **Async Throughput:** Verify and improve the concurrency of the "Real-Time Adapter Framework".
- [ ] **Database Optimization:** Review and optimize queries generated by the new Pydantic-based configuration and structured data storage.

## Dependencies
- **Visionary/Architect:** Implementation of the "Structured Data Sidecar" and "Real-Time Adapter Framework".
- **Steward:** Definition of latency budgets.

## Context
By Sprint 3, the "Sidecar" and "Real-Time" components should be in a prototype or early implementation phase. These introduce significant risk of latency regression. My focus shifts from the batch pipeline to these interactive/real-time components.

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Sidecar Optimization PR:** Code changes to ensure the sidecar meets latency budgets.
2. **Concurrency Tuning:** Configuration or code changes to maximize async throughput.
3. **Query Optimization:** Added indexes or rewritten queries for the new structured data.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Real-time features are inherently slow (LLM latency) | High | High | Focus on minimizing *overhead* (serialization, networking) since we can't control LLM speed. |
| Feature delivery is delayed | Medium | High | Fallback to further optimizing the batch pipeline or addressing technical debt. |

## Proposed Collaborations
- **With Visionary:** Validate that the "Sidecar" meets the vision without killing performance.
- **With Sentinel:** Ensure security checks on real-time inputs don't introduce DoS vectors (ReDoS, etc.).
