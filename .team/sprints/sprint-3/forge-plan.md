# Plan: Forge ⚒️ - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Forge ⚒️
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** High

## Objectives
My mission is to enhance interactivity, performance, and information architecture, aligning with Curator's vision.

- [ ] **Related Content Feature (MVP):** Implement a "Read Next" or "Related Stories" section on post pages to increase engagement.
- [ ] **Typography & Navigation Refinement:** Implement Curator's typography scale and improved navigation (e.g., breadcrumbs) for better readability and wayfinding.
- [ ] **Deep Accessibility Audit:** Achieve WCAG AA compliance. Fix issues identified in Sprint 2.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization:** Optimize asset loading, fonts, and scripts to achieve 95+ Lighthouse Performance score.
- [ ] **Mobile Polish:** Dedicated testing and refinement for mobile viewports.

## Dependencies
- **Curator:** For design specs on typography, navigation, and related content logic.

## Context
After establishing identity in Sprint 2, Sprint 3 focuses on Quality (Speed, A11y) and enhancing the Content Experience (Navigation, Discovery).

## Expected Deliverables
1. Functional "Related Content" section.
2. Refined Typography and Navigation system.
3. WCAG AA Compliance.
4. 95+ Performance Score.
5. Polished Mobile Experience.

## Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Performance tuning might require changes to build process | Low | Medium | Coordinate with Simplifier/Artisan if build tool changes are needed. |
| "Related Content" logic complexity | Medium | Medium | Implement a simple tag-based or heuristic MVP first, as agreed with Curator. |
