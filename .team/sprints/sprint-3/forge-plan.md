# Plan: Forge - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Forge ⚒️
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives
Following the "Identity" work in Sprint 2, Sprint 3 will focus on **Excellence**—specifically Performance and Accessibility.

- [ ] **Lighthouse Audit:** Achieve 95+ scores on Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO for the generated homepage and article pages.
- [ ] **Accessibility (a11y) Retrofit:** Ensure full keyboard navigability and screen reader support, addressing any issues found in the Sprint 2 visual overhaul.
- [ ] **Search Optimization:** Tune the MkDocs search configuration for better relevance and faster indexing on larger sites.

## Dependencies
- **Curator:** Feedback on any visual changes required for accessibility (e.g., contrast adjustments).

## Context
Once the site looks good (Sprint 2), it must *feel* good and work for everyone. Sprint 3 is about refining the engine under the hood. We want the "Portal" to be blazing fast and inclusive.

## Expected Deliverables
1.  **Lighthouse Report:** A report showing green scores across the board.
2.  **A11y Statement:** A generated accessibility statement page.
3.  **Optimized Assets:** Image optimization pipeline (if not fully covered in Sprint 2).

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Third-party scripts (if any) dragging down performance | Low | Medium | Strict auditing of any included JS. |
| Contrast requirements conflicting with "Portal" aesthetic | Medium | Medium | Work closely with Curator to find compliant color variations. |

## Proposed Collaborations
- **With Curator:** Accessibility reviews.
