# Plan: Forge ⚒️ - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Forge ⚒️
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** High

## Objectives
My mission is to enhance interactivity, performance, and information architecture, aligning with Curator's vision.

- [ ] **Related Content Feature (MVP):** Implement a "Read Next" or "Related Stories" section on post pages.
- [ ] **Typography & Navigation Refinement:** Implement Curator's typography scale and improved navigation (breadcrumbs).
- [ ] **VS Code Plugin Support:** Assist Visionary with TypeScript implementation for the "Hello World" plugin.
- [ ] **Deep Accessibility Audit:** Achieve WCAG AA compliance.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization:** Achieve 95+ Lighthouse Performance score.

## Dependencies
- **Curator:** Design specs.
- **Visionary:** Context Layer API for the VS Code plugin.

## Context
Sprint 3 focuses on "Platform" (VS Code) and "Content Experience" (Navigation, Discovery).

## Expected Deliverables
1. Functional "Related Content" section.
2. Refined Navigation system.
3. VS Code Plugin prototype (TypeScript support).
4. WCAG AA Compliance.

## Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Plugin development distracts from Web UX | Low | Medium | Timebox plugin support to "Consulting/Setup" rather than full ownership. |
