# Plan: Refactor - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Refactor
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2024-07-29 (during sprint-1)
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives

My mission is to improve code quality and eliminate technical debt. For Sprint 3, the objectives are:

- [ ] Investigate and address any remaining `vulture` warnings that were not fixed in Sprint 2.
- [ ] Continue to monitor and fix any new `ruff` warnings.
- [ ] Begin a review of the test suite to identify areas for improvement in coverage and efficiency.

## Dependencies

- None identified at this time.

## Context

This plan is a continuation of the work done in Sprint 2. After addressing the most pressing technical debt, the focus will shift to a more proactive approach to improving code quality. This includes a review of the test suite to ensure it is as effective as possible.

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Clean Bill of Health:** No new `ruff` or `vulture` warnings.
2. **Test Suite Review:** A document outlining areas for improvement in the test suite.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Review of test suite reveals major issues | Low | High | Prioritize fixing any critical issues found. |

## Proposed Collaborations

- None at this time.

## Additional Notes

This work will help to ensure the long-term health and maintainability of the codebase.
