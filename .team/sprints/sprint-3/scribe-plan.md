# Plan: Scribe - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Scribe ✍️
**Sprint:** 3
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives

Focus on Practical Content and Guides to support users and integrators.

- [ ] **Create Examples Section:** Develop end-to-end examples (e.g., "WhatsApp to Blog", "Custom Adapter").
- [ ] **Create Integration Guides:** Write guides for creating custom Input Adapters and Agents.
- [ ] **Index Internal Docs:** Organize and expose internal analysis documents (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md`) in a dedicated "Internal" section.

## Dependencies

## Context
With the foundation and reference docs in place, Sprint 3 shifts focus to "Learning" and "How-to" content to drive adoption and extensibility.

## Expected Deliverables
1. New "Examples" section with at least 3 guides.
2. Integration guides for Adapters and Agents.
3. Indexed Internal Documentation section.
