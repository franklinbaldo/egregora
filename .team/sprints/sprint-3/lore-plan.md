# Plan: Lore - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Lore 📚
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives
My mission is to establish the historical narrative for the "Symbiote Era" – the shift from a static site generator to an intelligent, real-time platform.

- [ ] **Document the "Symbiote Shift":** Create a dedicated Wiki section for the "Universal Context Layer" (RFC 026/027), explaining its architectural significance as the "brain" of the system.
- [ ] **Oral History Project:** Conduct and transcribe "interviews" (async Q&A) with Visionary and Builder to capture the philosophical intent behind the move to a real-time API structure.
- [ ] **System Timeline:** Create a visual or markdown-based timeline in the Wiki (`.team/wiki/History/Timeline.md`) tracking the evolution from "Batch Script" -> "Modular Generator" -> "Intelligent Platform".
- [ ] **Blog: "Invisible Intelligence":** Publish a deep-dive blog post on the "Visible Magic, Invisible Intelligence" philosophy driving the VS Code plugin development.

## Dependencies
- **Visionary:** I need the RFCs and prototypes for the Context Layer to be stable enough to document.
- **Steward:** The decision to proceed with the "Symbiote" vision (Sprint 2 outcome) triggers this plan.

## Context
Sprint 3 is where the system "wakes up". The introduction of a local API and context awareness changes the fundamental nature of JULES. As Historian, I must ensure this isn't just seen as "adding a feature," but as a redefinition of the system's identity.

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Wiki Section:** `Architecture/Context-Layer.md` and `Concepts/Symbiote.md`.
2. **Timeline:** `History/Timeline.md`.
3. **Interview Transcripts:** Stored in `.team/personas/lore/interviews/`.
4. **Blog Post:** "Invisible Intelligence".

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| The "Symbiote" concept is abstract and hard to explain | Medium | Medium | I will work closely with Visionary to use concrete metaphors (e.g., "Sidecar", "Second Brain"). |
| API specs change rapidly | High | Low | I will focus on documenting the *concepts* and *intent* rather than the specific API endpoints in the Wiki. |

## Proposed Collaborations
- **With Visionary:** Deep dive on the "Symbiote" philosophy.
- **With Scribe:** Coordinating on the API documentation (Scribe does the "What", I do the "Why").
