# Plan: Lore - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Lore 📚
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives
My mission is to document the birth of the "Symbiote Era" and ensuring the new real-time patterns are understood as a distinct evolutionary step.

- [ ] **Chronicle the "Symbiote" Inception:** specific Wiki entry documenting the shift to real-time and structured data sidecars.
- [ ] **Blog Post: "Friction Hunting":** A narrative analysis of the user friction points identified by the Visionary.
- [ ] **Maintain ADR Historical Integrity:** Continue reviewing ADRs to ensure they capture the "Context/History" effectively.
- [ ] **Audit "Lore Drift":** Check if the implementation of the Symbiote matches the documented vision, and update the Wiki to reflect reality.

## Dependencies
- **Visionary:** I rely on the RFCs and "Friction Hunting" reports.
- **Builder:** I need the "Structured Data Sidecar" to be implemented to document it.

## Context
Sprint 3 is where the new "Symbiote" ideas start to become code. My role is to ensure this isn't just "new code" but a "new chapter". I need to frame the narrative so future personas understand *why* we added real-time capabilities.

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Wiki Page:** `Architecture-Symbiote-Era.md` (or update to Architecture).
2. **Blog Post:** "Friction as Fuel" (Narrative on Visionary's work).
3. **Wiki Updates:** Keeping the documentation in sync with the rapid changes.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| The "Symbiote" vision changes rapidly | High | Medium | I will focus on documenting the *decisions* (ADRs) rather than the volatile implementation details. |

## Proposed Collaborations
- **With Visionary:** To capture the narrative of the "Friction Hunting".
