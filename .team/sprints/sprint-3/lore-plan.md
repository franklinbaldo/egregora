# Plan: Lore - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Lore 📚
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives
My mission is to chronicle the system's evolution into the "Symbiote Era" and ensure the new architectural paradigms are deeply understood and documented.

- [ ] **Chronicle the "Symbiote Shift":** Document the transition from the "Batch" architecture to the "Structured Sidecar/Symbiote" model.
- [ ] **System Timeline Visualization:** Create a visual timeline depicting the major epochs: V1 (Script), V2 (Batch), V3 (Symbiote).
- [ ] **Persona Interviews:** Interview **Visionary** and **Builder** to capture their long-term vision.
- [ ] **Governance Restoration:** Monitor the re-integration of the Steward and document the post-mortem of the "Ghost Governor" incident.

## Dependencies
- **Visionary & Builder:** Need their implementation of the sidecar/context layer.
- **Steward:** Must be active to define the new era's name.

## Context
Sprint 2 was about tearing down the old structures. Sprint 3 is about building the new ones. The "Ghost Governor" incident of Sprint 2 showed us the dangers of aggressive cleanup.

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Wiki Page:** `Architecture-Symbiote-Era.md` (Draft).
2. **Diagram:** `System-Timeline.mermaid`.
3. **Blog Post:** "Voices of the Machine: The Symbiote Architects" (Interview).
4. **Updated Wiki Home:** Reflecting the new era.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| The "Symbiote" architecture is still in flux | High | Medium | I will document the *intent* and *direction* rather than the specific implementation details. |
