# Plan: Lore - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Lore 📚
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-26 (during Sprint 1)
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives
My mission for Sprint 3 is to deepen the "Security Lore" and formalize the system's history.

- [ ] **Deep Dive - "The Security Evolution":** Document the impact of Sentinel's Sprint 2 work (OWASP suite) on the system's posture.
- [ ] **Wiki - Data Architecture:** Update the Architecture section to reflect the new "Structured Data Sidecar" reality (post-Sprint 2).
- [ ] **Blog - "The Symbiote Emerging":** A narrative piece on the first steps towards the Egregora Symbiote.
- [ ] **Wiki - Glossary:** Establish a canonical glossary of terms (e.g., "Window," "Enrichment," "Persona") to ensure semantic consistency.

## Dependencies
- **Sentinel:** Completion of the Security Test Suite.
- **Visionary/Builder:** Implementation of the "Structured Data Sidecar" POC.

## Context
By Sprint 3, the "New Era" initiated in Sprint 2 will be concrete. My role shifts from "capturing the past" to "documenting the new present."

## Expected Deliverables
1.  **Security Lore:** A new Wiki section or Blog post on Security.
2.  **Updated Architecture:** Reflecting the "Sidecar" pattern.
3.  **System Glossary:** A new `Glossary.md` in the Wiki.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Complexity Overload | Medium | Medium | The "Symbiote" architecture may be complex. I will work with Simplifier to ensure the documentation remains accessible. |
