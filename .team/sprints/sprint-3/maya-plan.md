# Plan: Maya - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Maya 💝
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** High

## Objectives

<<<<<<< HEAD
My mission is to ensure the "Reading Experience" is perfect for mobile users and that technical expansions (like VS Code plugins) don't confuse the core audience.

- [ ] **Mobile-First Review:** rigorously test the new blog design on a mobile screen simulator. It must look perfect on a small screen.
- [ ] **"Related Content" Magic Check:** Evaluate the "Related Stories" feature. It should feel like a thoughtful recommendation, not a random list.
- [ ] **De-risk "VS Code":** Ensure the "VS Code Plugin" is clearly communicated as an *optional tool for developers*, not a requirement for using Egregora.
- [ ] **Accessibility Verification:** Verify that the "WCAG AA" improvements actually make the site easier to read (contrast, font size).

## Dependencies

- **Forge:** I am the primary tester for the Mobile Polish and Accessibility work.
- **Curator:** I will review the "Related Content" logic to ensure it makes emotional sense.

## Context

Sprint 3 adds "Discovery" (Related Content) and "Expansion" (API/Plugin). Discovery is magical for me—finding forgotten memories. But "API" and "Plugin" sound like complexity. I need to make sure the core product remains simple and the new developer tools stay in the background.

## Expected Deliverables

1.  **Mobile UX Report:** Screenshots and feedback on the mobile reading experience.
2.  **"Is it Magic?" Report:** A qualitative review of the "Related Content" suggestions.
3.  **Documentation Feedback:** Specific edits to ensure the VS Code plugin isn't presented as a requirement.
=======
My mission is to translate the "Symbiote Shift" (Context Layer) into user value. If we're adding "Git History" to chats, it needs to tell a story, not just show hashes.

- [ ] **Evaluate "Context Layer" Value:** Test the new "Code References" feature. Does it make sense to a non-developer? (e.g., "This conversation sparked this feature").
- [ ] **Advocate for "Story Mode" vs "Dev Mode":** Ensure that technical data (SHAs, file paths) can be toggled off for family albums.
- [ ] **Push for One-Click Install:** Continue to advocate for simplifying the installation process (`uv tool install` is still scary).
- [ ] **Review "Structured Sidecar" Output:** If we are changing how data is stored, ensure the final blog post still looks beautiful.

## Dependencies

- **Visionary:** I depend on their implementation of the "Symbiote" features to review them.
- **Forge/Curator:** I assume visual identity work will be mostly done, but I will monitor for regressions.

## Context

Sprint 3 focuses on the "Symbiote Shift". To me, "Symbiote" sounds technical. I want to frame it as "Memory Context" - understanding *why* a conversation happened. My role is to ensure we sell the *story*, not the *database*.

## Expected Deliverables

1.  **UX Review of Code References:** A report on whether "linking code to chat" feels magical or confusing.
2.  **"Human Language" Suggestions:** Renaming technical terms in the UI (e.g., "Git History" -> "Project Timeline").
3.  **Installation Feedback:** Continued pressure to simplify the `README.md` steps.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
<<<<<<< HEAD
| User confusion about VS Code | High | Medium | I will demand a clear "For Developers" section in the docs. |
| "Related Content" makes no sense | Medium | High | I will check the logic manually against real stories. |

## Proposed Collaborations

- **With Visionary:** Helping frame the "Context Layer" as a feature that *powers* the magic, not a feature in itself.
- **With Forge:** Iterating on font sizes and touch targets for mobile.

## Additional Notes

"The best technology is the one you don't notice."
=======
| "Symbiote" features clutter the UI | High | High | I will propose a "Simple View" toggle for the final site. |
| Complexity increases for end users | High | High | I will test the "Zero Config" promise against every new feature. |

## Proposed Collaborations

- **With Visionary:** Helping frame the "Symbiote" features for non-technical users.
- **With Simplifier:** Discussing how to make the installation simpler.
