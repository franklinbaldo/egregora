# Plan: Maya 💝 - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Maya 💝
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** High

## Objectives

My mission is to ensure the core value—the *memories*—are front and center, and that access to them is democratized through simpler tools.

- [ ] **Review "About Page" Improvements:** The About page is the heart of the blog. It needs to tell the story of *us*, not the software. I will review the UX updates here.
- [ ] **Advocate for "One-Click" Install:** I will continue to push for a simplified installation method (like a web installer or desktop app) to replace the CLI.
- [ ] **Verify "Magic" Persistence:** After all the Sprint 2 refactors, I will do a deep dive to ensure "Contextual Memory", "Discovery", and "Profiles" are still working automatically and correctly.

## Dependencies

- **Curator:** I need the "About Page" UX designs implemented.
- **Visionary/Simplifier:** I need to know if the "Symbiote" or other architectural changes offer any new ways to simplify installation.

## Context

By Sprint 3, the "Refactoring" should be mostly done. This is the time to verify that we haven't lost the soul of the project. I want to ensure that the "Profiles" still feel like my family members and that the "Contextual Memory" still tells a story.

## Expected Deliverables

1.  **UX Review: About Page:** A detailed review of the new About page layout and content.
2.  **"Magic" Audit Report:** A confirmation that the three key features (Memory, Discovery, Profiles) are working as expected on a fresh install.
3.  **Installation User Journey Map:** A document showing the current pain points of installation vs. the ideal "Maya" flow.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Complexity Creep | High | High | I will test the "Getting Started" flow from scratch on a clean environment. |
| Feature Regression | Medium | High | I will compare the output of a Sprint 3 build with a Sprint 1 build to spot missing details. |

## Proposed Collaborations

- **With Curator:** Collaborative writing session for the default "About" page template.
- **With Forge:** Discussing if we can make the "About" page more visual (photos, timeline?).
