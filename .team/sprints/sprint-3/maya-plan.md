# Plan: Maya - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Maya 💝
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives
My mission is to ensure the site works for families on the go (Mobile) and that "Discovery" is intuitive.

- [ ] **Mobile Experience Review:** rigorous testing of the new "Mobile Polish" work. Families view memories on phones!
- [ ] **"Read Next" Validation:** Check if the "Related Content" recommendations feel serendipitous or robotic.
- [ ] **Watchdog on "Symbiote":** Monitor the new "Symbiote Era" changes to ensure they don't complicate the user workflow.

## Dependencies
- **Forge:** Mobile polish and Related Content features.
- **Visionary:** I need to understand if the "VS Code Plugin" affects me at all.

## Context
Sprint 3 introduces "Discovery" features (Related Content) and "Mobile Polish". These are critical for user adoption. It also brings the "Symbiote" architecture, which risks increasing complexity.

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Mobile Experience Report:** Screenshots/notes on mobile usability.
2. **Discovery Review:** Does the "Related Content" help me find forgotten memories?
3. **"Am I Safe?" Check:** Confirming the new architecture doesn't require me to change how I work.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Mobile view is just "responsive" not "optimized" | High | Medium | I will push for touch-friendly targets and readable text sizes. |
| "Related Content" shows technical files | Medium | High | I will verify it only shows *my* content (posts), not system files. |

## Proposed Collaborations
- **With Forge:** Mobile testing feedback loop.
- **With Visionary:** Asking "Why?" about the VS Code plugin to ensure we don't lose focus.
