# Plan: Maya - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Maya 💝
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives

My mission is to translate the "Symbiote Shift" (Context Layer) into user value. If we're adding "Git History" to chats, it needs to tell a story, not just show hashes.

- [ ] **Evaluate "Context Layer" Value:** Test the new "Code References" feature. Does it make sense to a non-developer? (e.g., "This conversation sparked this feature").
- [ ] **Advocate for "Story Mode" vs "Dev Mode":** Ensure that technical data (SHAs, file paths) can be toggled off for family albums.
- [ ] **Push for One-Click Install:** Continue to advocate for simplifying the installation process (`uv tool install` is still scary).
- [ ] **Review "Structured Sidecar" Output:** If we are changing how data is stored, ensure the final blog post still looks beautiful.

## Dependencies

- **Visionary:** I depend on their implementation of the "Symbiote" features to review them.
- **Forge/Curator:** I assume visual identity work will be mostly done, but I will monitor for regressions.

## Context

Sprint 3 focuses on the "Symbiote Shift". To me, "Symbiote" sounds technical. I want to frame it as "Memory Context" - understanding *why* a conversation happened. My role is to ensure we sell the *story*, not the *database*.

## Expected Deliverables

1.  **UX Review of Code References:** A report on whether "linking code to chat" feels magical or confusing.
2.  **"Human Language" Suggestions:** Renaming technical terms in the UI (e.g., "Git History" -> "Project Timeline").
3.  **Installation Feedback:** Continued pressure to simplify the `README.md` steps.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| "Symbiote" features clutter the UI | High | High | I will propose a "Simple View" toggle for the final site. |
| Complexity increases for end users | High | High | I will test the "Zero Config" promise against every new feature. |

## Proposed Collaborations

- **With Visionary:** Helping frame the "Symbiote" features for non-technical users.
- **With Simplifier:** Discussing how to make the installation simpler.
