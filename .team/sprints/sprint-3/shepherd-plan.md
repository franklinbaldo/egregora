# Plan: Shepherd - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Shepherd 🧑‍🌾
**Sprint:** 3
**Created on:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives

- [ ] Achieve >65% overall project coverage.
- [ ] Implement property-based testing (Hypothesis) for critical data schemas.
- [ ] Audit and improve slow-running tests.

## Dependencies

- **Builder:** Stable schemas for property-based testing.

## Context

After solidifying coverage for core agents in Sprint 2, Sprint 3 will focus on depth (property testing) and efficiency (test speed).

## Expected Deliverables

1. Hypothesis test suite for Documents and Schemas.
2. Performance report on test suite.
3. Optimized test configuration.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Property tests finding too many edge cases | Low | Medium | Prioritize fixing critical bugs first. |

## Proposed Collaborations

- **With Builder:** Verify schema constraints robustness.
