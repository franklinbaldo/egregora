<<<<<<< ours
<<<<<<< ours
**Persona:** Steward
**Sprint:** 3
**Created at:** 2024-07-29
**Priority:** High

## Objectives

Describe the main objectives for this sprint:

- [ ] **Review and refine the ADR process.** Based on the experiences from Sprint 2, I will gather feedback from the other personas and make any necessary adjustments to the ADR process to improve its effectiveness.
- [ ] **Identify and prioritize a key area for technical debt reduction.** I will analyze the codebase and the feedback from the other personas to identify a key area where we can reduce technical debt, and I will create a task for the appropriate persona to address it.
- [ ] **Facilitate a sprint retrospective and planning session.** I will lead a discussion with the other personas to review our progress in Sprint 2 and plan our work for Sprint 4, ensuring that we are continuously improving our processes and staying aligned on our goals.

## Dependencies

List dependencies on work from other personas:

- **All Personas:** I will need active participation from all personas in the sprint retrospective and planning session.

## Context

Explain the context and reasoning behind this plan:

With a formal ADR process in place, Sprint 3 is an opportunity to focus on continuous improvement. By refining our processes, addressing technical debt, and engaging in collaborative planning, we can ensure that we are building a high-quality, sustainable project.

## Expected Deliverables

1.  An updated ADR process document.
2.  A new task in the `.team/tasks/todo/` directory for technical debt reduction.
3.  A summary of the Sprint 2 retrospective and the Sprint 4 plan.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lack of consensus on technical debt priorities. | Medium | Medium | I will facilitate a discussion to ensure that we reach a consensus on the most important areas to address. |
| Difficulty in scheduling a time for all personas to meet. | Low | Medium | I will be flexible and work with the other personas to find a time that works for everyone. |

## Proposed Collaborations

- **With All Personas:** The sprint retrospective and planning session will be a highly collaborative effort.

## Additional Notes

None.

**Persona:** Steward 🧠
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-12 (during Sprint 1)
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives
Sprint 3 will be about building on the momentum of Sprint 2. My focus will be on reviewing the outcomes of the previous sprint and using those insights to guide the next phase of work.

- [ ] **Review Sprint 2 Outcomes:** Analyze the results of Sprint 2, including the foundational improvements, the UX baseline, and the "Structured Data Sidecar" experiment.
- [ ] **Prioritize Foundational Work:** Continue to prioritize and sequence the refactoring and code quality work being done by the Artisan and Refactor personas.
- [ ] **Implement UX Vision:** Guide the implementation of the UX vision defined by the Curator in Sprint 2.
- [ ] **Decide on "Egregora Symbiote":** Based on the results of the "Structured Data Sidecar," make a formal decision on whether to proceed with the larger "Egregora Symbiote" vision.

## Dependencies
- **All Personas:** The success of Sprint 3 depends on the successful completion of the goals outlined in Sprint 2.

## Context
By Sprint 3, we should have a more stable and secure platform, a clear UX direction, and a better understanding of the feasibility of the "Egregora Symbiote" vision. My role will be to synthesize these inputs and create a clear, actionable strategy for the next phase of development.

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Sprint 3 Kick-off:** A clear set of strategic priorities for Sprint 3, communicated to all personas.
2. **Updated Roadmap:** An updated project roadmap that reflects the decisions made at the end of Sprint 2.
3. **ADR for "Egregora Symbiote":** A formal ADR documenting the decision on whether to proceed with the "Egregora Symbiote" vision.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Sprint 2 Goals Not Met | Medium | High | I will work with the other personas to adjust the Sprint 3 plan as needed to account for any delays or changes in scope. |
| Lack of Consensus on "Egregora Symbiote" | Medium | Medium | I will facilitate a final round of discussions and, if necessary, make a final decision to ensure we have a clear path forward. |
