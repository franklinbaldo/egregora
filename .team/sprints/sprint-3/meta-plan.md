# Plan: Meta - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Meta 🔍
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives
Focus on "Discovery", "Symbiote Shift" documentation, and system integrity.

- [ ] **Support Lore in "Symbiote Shift" Docs:** Collaborate with Lore to ensure the new "Era" is documented not just historically but operationally in `docs/personas.md` (e.g., if new roles like "Symbiote Architect" are formalized).
- [ ] **Audit Context Layer Integration:** Verify if the "Git History" context (Visionary's work) requires updates to the `PersonaLoader` or base templates.
- [ ] **Audit New Features:** Document the new "Related Content" and "Feeds" features in the system wiki.
- [ ] **Persona Template Update:** If new capabilities are added (e.g., Mobile testing tools), update the persona base template.

## Dependencies
- **Curator/Forge:** Waiting for their implementation of Discovery features.
- **Visionary/Lore:** Waiting for the definition of the "Symbiote" architecture.

## Context
Sprint 3 is about User Experience and a major Architectural Shift ("Symbiote"). Meta's role is to ensure the system documentation doesn't lag behind this shift.

## Expected Deliverables
1. Updated Wiki/Docs for new features.
2. `docs/personas.md` reflecting the Symbiote Era.
3. Sprint 3 Feedback.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| "Symbiote" complexity confuses agents | Medium | High | I will ensure the prompt templates are updated with clear instructions on how to use the new context. |
