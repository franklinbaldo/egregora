# Plan: Meta - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Meta 🔍
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives
Focus on "Discovery" and "Mobile Polish" support from a system perspective.

- [ ] **Audit New Features:** Document the new "Related Content" and "Feeds" features in the system wiki/docs once implemented by Curator/Forge.
- [ ] **Persona Template Update:** If new capabilities are added (e.g., Mobile testing tools), update the persona base template (`base/persona.md.j2`).
- [ ] **Sprint Feedback:** Review and provide feedback for Sprint 3 plans.

## Dependencies
- **Curator/Forge:** Waiting for their implementation of Discovery features.

## Context
Sprint 3 is about User Experience. Meta's role shifts to documenting these new user-facing features for the internal team and ensuring the persona infrastructure supports mobile testing if needed.

## Expected Deliverables
1. Updated Wiki/Docs for new features.
2. Sprint 3 Feedback.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| New features are undocumented | Medium | Medium | I will pair with Scribe to ensure coverage. |
