# Plan: Curator 🎭 - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Curator 🎭
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives
My mission is to design the user experience for the new "Context Layer" (Git History and Code References) and ensure the site evolves into a true "Symbiote" interface.

- [ ] **Context Layer UX:** Design how Git history and code references are presented to the user. How does a user "travel back in time" via a link?
- [ ] **Structured Sidecar UI:** Ensure that the structured data exposed by the backend is presented meaningfully in the UI (e.g., rich metadata sidebars, improved search facets).
- [ ] **Mobile Refinement:** Perform a dedicated mobile UX audit and refinement pass, ensuring the "Portal" experience works on small screens.

## Dependencies
- **Visionary & Simplifier:** Definition of the "Context Layer" capabilities.
- **Forge:** Implementation of the new UI components.

## Context
Sprint 3 moves beyond static polish into dynamic interaction. The "Symbiote Shift" adds a temporal dimension (history) to the content. This presents significant UX challenges: how to show this complexity without overwhelming the user?

## Expected Deliverables
1. **Context Layer Mockups/Specs:** detailed specifications for how history links should look and behave.
2. **Mobile UX Report:** specific tasks for mobile optimization.

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Context Layer is too complex for users | High | High | I will advocate for "progressive disclosure" – hiding complexity until requested. |
| Mobile experience is neglected | Medium | Medium | I have dedicated a specific objective to Mobile Refinement. |

## Proposed Collaborations
- **With Visionary:** To understand the full scope of the "Context Layer".
- **With Forge:** To prototype the new UI components.
