# Plan: Curator - Sprint 3

**Persona:** Curator
**Sprint:** 3
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Priority:** Medium

## Objectives

Elevate the reading experience and ensure inclusivity through typography and accessibility improvements.

- [ ] Conduct a comprehensive typography audit (scale, line-height, measure).
- [ ] Conduct an initial accessibility audit (WCAG AA baseline).
- [ ] Create tasks for identified improvements.

## Dependencies

- **Forge:** Will be needed to implement the CSS changes resulting from the audits.

## Context

Once the visual foundation is stabilized in Sprint 2, the focus must shift to the core purpose of the blog: reading. The current typography is functional but likely not optimized for long-form reading. Additionally, we must ensure the site is accessible to all users.

## Expected Deliverables

1.  **Typography Report:** A document outlining recommended changes to the type scale and spacing.
2.  **Accessibility Report:** A list of violations and recommended fixes.
3.  **New Tasks:** A set of `TODO.ux` tasks for Forge to implement the findings.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Scope creep | Medium | Medium | Focus strictly on WCAG AA and core readability metrics. |

## Proposed Collaborations

- **With Forge:** Discuss feasibility of implementing advanced typographic features (e.g., fluid type).
