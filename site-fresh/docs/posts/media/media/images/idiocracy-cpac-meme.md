![Two-panel meme comparing a figure holding a huge chainsaw at CPAC with the movie character President Camacho firing a gun from the movie Idiocracy.](IMG-20250303-WA0010.jpg)

## Description
A two-panel image meme contrasting a real-life political event with a scene from the movie *Idiocracy*. The top panel shows a man holding an absurdly large, weaponized chainsaw at a CPAC event. The bottom panel shows the character President Camacho from *Idiocracy* firing a massive machine gun while yelling, suggesting a commentary on political absurdity.
