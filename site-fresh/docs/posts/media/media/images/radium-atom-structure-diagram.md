# radium-atom-structure-diagram

![Vintage black and red diagram illustrating the complex orbital structure of the Radium (88) atom, featuring nested elliptical paths.](IMG-20250302-WA0022.jpg)

## Description
A vintage scientific illustration depicting the 'Structure of the Radium Atom' (Radium 88). The image uses nested black and red loops and ovals to represent electron paths or energy shells, creating a complex, flower-like geometric pattern. Dotted lines extend to the right with numerical labels indicating quantum shells.
