# tower-of-babel-ai-graph

![Social media post pairing a painting of the Tower of Babel with a complex scientific graph related to computational scaling, captioned "I don't want to be an alarmist or anything..."](IMG-20250303-WA0024.jpg)

## Description
A screenshot of a social media post (X/Twitter) featuring a meme that pairs two disparate images. On the left is a classical painting of the Tower of Babel, symbolizing ambitious human endeavors. On the right is a complex logarithmic graph showing downward-trending lines related to computational scaling, likely commenting on the complexity or resource consumption of AI models.
