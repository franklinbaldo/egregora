# RFC: Egregora FM
**Status:** Moonshot Proposal
**Date:** 2025-05-28
**Disruption Level:** High (Multi-Modal Shift)

## 1. The Vision
It's Monday morning. You're commuting. Instead of scrolling through 800 unread messages from "The Weekend Crew," you tap a button on your podcast app.

**"Welcome back to Egregora FM,"** says a voice that sounds eerily like the collective vibe of your group—witty, slightly chaotic, but warm. **"This weekend was… intense. Dave started a debate about carbonara that lasted six hours, and Sarah posted 45 photos of her cat. Let's dive in."**

For the next 5 minutes, two AI hosts (a "Play-by-Play" announcer and a "Color Commentator") banter through the highlights. They play audio clips (synthesized reenactments or actual voice notes). They verify facts ("Dave claimed carbonara uses cream. Fact check: False."). They summarize the mood.

You laugh, you get caught up, and you arrive at work feeling connected, without the "unreads anxiety."

## 2. The Broken Assumption
> "We currently assume that the output of a chat archive must be text (a blog), but this prevents us from engaging users who are fatigued by reading."

We treat Egregora as a *publishing* engine (Atom/RSS -> HTML). But the Atom spec supports `enclosure` links (podcasts). We are stuck in the "Gutenberg Parenthesis"—thinking print is the primary medium for knowledge. Group chats are conversational; their natural summary format is *conversation*, not an essay.

## 3. The Mechanics (High Level)

### Input
*   **Chat Logs:** The standard `Entry` stream.
*   **Prosody/Vibe Analysis:** Analyze the sentiment, capitalization, and emoji usage to determine the "emotional tone" of segments.
*   **Voice Notes:** Extract audio attachments (already supported in V3 plan) and transcribe them (Speech-to-Text) for context, but keep raw audio for mixing.

### Processing
1.  **The Scriptwriter Agent:** A specialized `WriterAgent` persona. Instead of writing a blog post, it writes a *script* for two voices. It includes stage directions: `[Sound effect: Gavel banging]`, `[Host 1 sighs]`.
2.  **The Audio Director:** A new component. It takes the script and calls a Text-to-Speech API (ElevenLabs/OpenAI/Gemini).
    *   It assigns consistent voices to the hosts.
    *   (Moonshot Extension) It clones the voices of participants (with consent) for quoting them directly.
3.  **The Mixer:** Uses `ffmpeg` (wrapped in Python) to stitch the TTS output, background music (generated by AI or stock), and original voice note snippets into a single `.mp3`.

### Output
*   **The Artifact:** An `.mp3` file (e.g., `2025-05-28-weekend-digest.mp3`).
*   **The Delivery:** The Atom Feed (`feed.xml`) includes `<link rel="enclosure" href="..." type="audio/mpeg" />`.
*   **The UX:** Any podcast player (Apple Podcasts, Overcast) can subscribe to your private Egregora feed.

## 4. The Value Proposition
*   **10x Delight:** Transforming "homework" (reading logs) into "entertainment" (listening to a show).
*   **Accessibility:** consume the group chat while driving, running, or cooking.
*   **Emotional Resonance:** Hearing the "voice" of the group creates a stronger bond than reading text.
*   **Differentiation:** No other "chat to blog" tool does this. It makes Egregora not just an archiver, but a *media production studio*.
