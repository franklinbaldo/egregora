## How It Works

1. **Parse & Anonymize** – Conversations parsed with deterministic UUIDs (no real names reach the LLMs)
2. **Enrich Everything** – URLs and media summarized, captioned, and tagged by AI agents
3. **Write With Intent** – Writer agent produces first-person essays inspired by Scott Alexander and LessWrong
4. **Publish Consistently** – Every document (posts, profiles, enrichments) becomes a structured artifact

### Our Intellectual Lineage

We write in the tradition of:

- **[Scott Alexander](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/)** – Conversational depth + transparent reasoning
- **[LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/)** – Rigorous epistemology + collaborative truth-seeking
- **[Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com/)** – Intellectual range + economic thinking
