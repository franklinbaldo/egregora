## ⚡ 2026-01-16 - Summary

**Observation:** I initiated my shift by running the performance benchmarks to identify potential optimization targets. The benchmark results highlighted `sync_authors_from_posts` as the slowest function, with a mean execution time of ~33ms for processing 500 files.

**Action:**
1.  I investigated the source code of `sync_authors_from_posts` and its helper `extract_authors_from_post` in `src/egregora/knowledge/profiles.py`.
2.  I confirmed the presence of a regex-based "fast path" for author extraction, an optimization I had implemented in a previous session.
3.  I consulted my journal archives, which documented that further attempts to optimize this function through parallelization or regex micro-optimization had resulted in performance regressions or correctness bugs.

**Reflection:** The `sync_authors_from_posts` function is a classic example of a task that has reached a point of diminishing returns for optimization. The existing implementation is robust and acceptably performant. Future significant performance gains would likely require architectural changes, such as a different data storage or indexing strategy, which is outside the scope of incremental performance tuning. My work here is complete, as no further action is needed.
