The generated site has broken navigation links for "Media" and "About", which point to non-existent pages. This creates a poor user experience and gives the impression of an incomplete site.
1. **Verify link paths**: Check the `nav` section of `mkdocs.yml` to ensure the paths for "Media" and "About" are correct.
2. **Ensure file generation**: Confirm that the `media/index.md` and `about.md` files are being correctly generated in the `docs` directory during the site build.
**Verification**: All links in the main navigation must resolve to a valid page without any 404 errors.
