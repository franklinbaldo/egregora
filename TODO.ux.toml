id = "generate-meaningful-demo"
title = "Generate a demo blog with actual post content"
description = """
The current demo generation process results in a site with zero blog posts, making it impossible to evaluate the primary UX of the blog.
WHY it matters: The core purpose of Egregora is to generate a blog. If the demo doesn't contain a blog, no meaningful UX evaluation can occur. This is a blocker for all future UX work.
WHAT to change: The `egregora write` command and/or the sample data at `tests/fixtures/` must be fixed to produce at least 3-5 sample blog posts.
HOW to verify: Run the `egregora init` and `egregora write` commands. The resulting site must have multiple, populated blog posts viewable under the '/posts' section of the website.
WHERE to look: The `egregora write` command's implementation, the input data in `tests/fixtures/`, and the output content of the `demo/docs/posts` directory after generation.

While the blog content is missing, a baseline audit of the existing documentation pages can provide initial metrics.
WHY it matters: Establishes a starting point for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO scores. This data will inform future improvements and allow for tracking progress.
WHAT to change: Run a Lighthouse audit in Chrome DevTools on the homepage of the generated demo site.
HOW to verify: The results of the Lighthouse audit are recorded in the `[lighthouse.baseline]` section of this TOML file.
WHERE to look: The homepage (index.html) of the running demo server.
