The default theme's body text is too small for comfortable long-form reading, and lines are too long on wide screens, causing eye strain. This task addresses these core readability issues.
1. **Font Size**: Increase the base body font size from the default (likely 16px) to 18px.
2. **Line Length**: Cap the main content column width to a maximum of 75 characters (approx `70ch` in CSS) to prevent overly long lines.
**Verification**: Inspect the CSS for the body font-size and the main content container's `max-width`. Visually confirm on a wide monitor that text is comfortable to read and lines are not excessively long. A readability score (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid) should improve.

To improve readability for long-form content, specific CSS rules must be added. This task provides the exact implementation details for Forge.

**File to Edit:**
`src/egregora/rendering/templates/site/overrides/stylesheets/extra.css`

**CSS to Add:**
```css
/* --- Core Readability Improvements --- */
/*
  - Increase base font size for comfortable long-form reading.
  - Cap content width to optimal line length (approx. 70 characters).
*/

.md-typeset {
  font-size: 1.1rem; /* Approx 17.6px, slightly larger for readability */
}

.md-main .md-content {
    max-width: 75ch; /* Optimal line length */
}
```

**Verification Steps:**
1. Generate the demo site after making the change.
2. Open a blog post and use browser developer tools.
3. **Check Font Size:** Inspect a paragraph (`<p>`) inside the `.md-typeset` container. The computed `font-size` should be `1.1rem` (or its pixel equivalent).
4. **Check Line Length:** Inspect the `.md-content` container. The `max-width` should be `75ch`. The text lines should not exceed this width on large screens.
