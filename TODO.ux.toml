description = """
**WHY:** The `mkdocs.yml` references `stylesheets/extra.css`, but this file does not exist in the generated scaffold. This is a high-priority blocker because it prevents ANY custom styling or UX improvements from being applied.

**WHAT:** Create the file `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/theme/stylesheets/extra.css`.

**HOW:** The scaffolding process in `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/scaffolding.py` needs to be updated to copy this file.

**VERIFY:** After running `egregora demo`, the file `demo/docs/stylesheets/extra.css` should exist.

description = """
**WHY:** The current theme uses the default Material for MkDocs 'teal' and 'amber' colors, which looks generic. A custom palette will give the blog a unique brand identity that reflects Egregora's 'collective consciousness' theme.

**WHAT:** Propose a new primary and accent color in `docs/ux-vision.md`. I will research colors associated with thought, connection, and clarity.

**HOW:** I will update the `docs/ux-vision.md` with a color palette proposal. Forge will then implement it in the `mkdocs.yml.jinja` template.

**VERIFY:** The generated `demo/.egregora/mkdocs.yml` should reflect the new color palette.

**WHY:** The site currently lacks a favicon, which makes it look unprofessional in browser tabs and bookmarks.

**WHAT:** A custom favicon needs to be designed and added to the theme.

**HOW:** I will design a simple, abstract icon representing 'Egregora'. Forge will then add the necessary files and configuration to `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/scaffolding.py` and the `mkdocs.yml.jinja` template.

**VERIFY:** The generated site should display the custom favicon in the browser tab.

**WHY:** The `mkdocs.yml` contains a placeholder `__GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_KEY__`. This is either a broken feature or a potential privacy concern if it's ever accidentally populated. Egregora should be privacy-first.

**WHAT:** The analytics configuration should be removed from the default template.

**HOW:** Forge should remove the `extra.analytics` section from the `mkdocs.yml.jinja` template in `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/scaffolding.py`.

**VERIFY:** The generated `demo/.egregora/mkdocs.yml` should not contain the `extra.analytics` block.

**WHY:** The current homepage message 'No posts yet. Run `egregora write`' is functional but cold and technical. First impressions matter for new users.

**WHAT:** The empty state message should be more welcoming and visually engaging.

**HOW:** I will propose new copy in `docs/ux-vision.md`. Forge will update the template in `src/egregora/output_adapters/mkdocs/adapter.py` that generates the `index.md`.

**VERIFY:** The `demo/docs/index.md` should contain the new, more engaging empty state content.

**WHAT:** The social plugin's image generation needs to be debugged.

**HOW:** Forge needs to investigate the `mkdocs-social-plugin` configuration and the file generation process to ensure the social card images are created and referenced correctly.

**VERIFY:** The `mkdocs build` command should complete without any 404 errors related to social card images.
